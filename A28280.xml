            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <p>Abraham ſaith unto him, They have Moſes and the Prophets; let them hear them.</p>
                     <p>And he ſaid, Nay, father Abraham: but if one went unto them from the dead, they will repent.</p>
                     <p>And he ſaid unto him, If they hear not Moſes and the Prophets, neither will they be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded, though one roſe from the dead.</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>THESE words contain ſome of the Diſcourſe that paſſed between <hi>Abraham</hi> in Heaven, and a certain <hi>rich Man</hi> in Hell; occaſioned by a Requeſt which he had made in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going Verſes, in the behalf of his <hi>five Brethren</hi> whom he had left alive upon Earth; that <hi>Abraham</hi> would be ſo kind as to <hi>ſend Lazarus to them, to teſtifie to them, leſt they alſo ſhould come into that Place of Torment.</hi> And the general Deſign of them, and indeed of the whole Parable of which they are a Part, is to aſſert the <hi>Sufficiency</hi> of thoſe Means which God hath thought fit to uſe to bring Men to Repentance, particularly by granting them a <hi>ſtanding Revelation</hi> of his Will; and the probable Unſucceſsfulneſs of any other Method that we could propoſe, and perhaps might think more proper for this Purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>And when theſe Words were firſt ſpoken, it was with a ſpecial Reference to the State of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:52663:5"/> and to that Light, and thoſe Means of Salvation which were afforded to them, at the Time when <hi>our Saviour</hi> began his Preaching; when all the <hi>ſtanding Revelation</hi> of God's Will, was contained in the Books of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and in the Writings of the <hi>Prophets.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But ſince then our Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> the eternal Son of God, a more credible Meſſenger than <hi>Lazarus</hi> from the dead, has come himſelf in Perſon to aſſure us that there is a Heaven and a Hell, and to ſhew us the Means of attaining that, and avoiding this; and God having raiſed him up from the dead, after he had been cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified by the <hi>Jews,</hi> has given ſufficient Aſſurance to the World of his divine Miſſion; And that <hi>Jeſus</hi> did and ſaid ſuch things, and that he died and roſe again, we have the Teſtimony of his <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> and others, who were Eye and Ear-witneſſes thereof, and who in Confirmation of their Teſtimony were em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powered by God to do as great Miracles as <hi>Jeſus</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf had done; And laſtly, of what was done and taught by <hi>our Saviour</hi> and his <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> we have very credible Records ſtill remaining, <hi>viz.</hi> the Books of the <hi>New Teſtament;</hi> the Authority of which is at leaſt as well proved to us, as ever the Authority of the <hi>Old Teſtament</hi> was to the <hi>Jews:</hi> So that we now have plainly more and ſtronger Motives to Repentance, than the <hi>Jews</hi> before <hi>our Saviour</hi>'s Time had; we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently do ſtand in leſs need of new Miracles and new Revelations than they did; And therefore the Argument in the Text, as it may be applied to us who live now, is much ſtronger than as it was here urged by <hi>Abraham</hi> with Reference to the <hi>Jews,</hi> while they had only <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>the Prophets.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="3" facs="tcp:52663:5"/>
                  <p>And thus in my Diſcourſe upon the Words, I ſhall now conſider it, <hi>viz.</hi> as if the Requeſt made by the <hi>rich Man</hi> in the Behalf of his Brethren, in the two foregoing Verſes, were made now in the Behalf of thoſe to whom the Revelation of the Goſpel has been given, but without Succeſs; and as if the Anſwer here returned to it by <hi>Abraham,</hi> had been ſuited to the preſent State of things.</p>
                  <p>And from the words, thus largely underſtood, I ſhall take occaſion to ſpeak to theſe Three Points.</p>
                  <p n="1">I. I ſhall endeavour to ſhew that the preſent <hi>ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Revelation</hi> of God's Will, contained in the Books of the <hi>Old</hi> and <hi>New Teſtament</hi> is abundantly <hi>ſufficient</hi> to perſwade Men to Repentance, if they are not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonably blind and obſtinate. <hi>They have Moſes and the Prophets,</hi> (I add, <hi>they have</hi> alſo <hi>Chriſt, and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles;) let them hear them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">II. I ſhall ſhew that having already ſuch good Grounds of Faith, ſuch full Directions for Practice, and ſuch ſtrong Motives to Repentance, it is an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable Requeſt to deſire more. <hi>Nay, Father Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, but if one went unto them from the dead, they will repent.</hi> And,</p>
                  <p n="3">III. Laſtly, I ſhall endeavour to ſhew, That in caſe God ſhould condeſcend to gratifie Men in this unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Deſire (working every Day new Miracles be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their Eyes, or ſending their deceaſed Friends to them from the dead, to aſſure them of a future State, and to warn them to prepare for it) 'tis highly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable that very few or none of thoſe who do not believe, and are not brought to Repentance by the Preaching and <hi>ſtanding Revelation</hi> of the Goſpel, would
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:52663:6"/> be perſwaded by this Means. <hi>If they hear not Moſes, and the Prophets (nor Chriſt and his Apoſtles) neither will they be perſwaded, though one roſe from the dead.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">I. I ſhall endeavour to ſhew that the preſent <hi>ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Revelation</hi> of God's Will, contained in the Books of the <hi>Old</hi> and <hi>New Teſtament</hi> is abundantly <hi>ſufficient</hi> to perſwade Men to Repentance, if they are not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonably blind and obſtinate. <hi>They have Moſes and the Prophets, (Chriſt and his Apoſtles) let them hear them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And, I think, that if the <hi>ſtanding Revelation</hi> which God hath made of his Will in the Holy Scriptures, can upon any account be thought <hi>inſufficient</hi> to effect this Deſign, it muſt be upon one of theſe two Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts; <hi>viz.</hi> Either, 1. Becauſe no <hi>ſtanding Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> can be <hi>ſufficient</hi> for this Purpoſe; Or, 2. Becauſe there are ſome particular Defects in that <hi>ſtanding Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation</hi> which we have in the <hi>Holy Scripture,</hi> which render it not ſo <hi>ſufficient</hi> for this Purpoſe as 'tis poſſible a <hi>ſtanding Revelation</hi> might be.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It may be pretended that no <hi>ſtanding Revelation</hi> can be <hi>ſufficient</hi> for this Purpoſe. I am now therefore to enquire with what Reaſon this can be pretended.</p>
                  <p>And in ſpeaking to this Point, it does not lie upon me to prove that God could not reveal his Mind afreſh to every Man in every Age of the World, if he ſo pleaſed; for there is no queſtion but that the ſame <hi>God who in divers manners ſpake in times paſt to our Fathers by the Prophets,</hi> could, if he pleaſed, ſpeak to every one of us their Children, in ſuch Manner as he then ſpake to the Prophets themſelves; ſo that we might be all immediately taught of God as they were. But
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:52663:6"/> every thing that may be done is not expedient to be done; And whether this Method would be expedient or not, will be hereafter enquired.</p>
                  <p>Neither does it now lie upon me to prove, that this Way which God hath thought fit to take to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct the greateſt Part of the World, <hi>viz.</hi> by a <hi>ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Revelation,</hi> is the beſt Way, and the moſt like to be effectual of any that could be uſed. Of this I ſhall likewiſe have Occaſion to ſpeak ſomewhat hereafter.</p>
                  <p>But what lies upon me at preſent to make good, is only this, That a <hi>ſtanding Revelation</hi> of God's Will may be ſo well contrived and ſo well atteſted as to be <hi>ſufficient</hi> to perſwade Men.</p>
                  <p>And if there be any Ground for the contrary Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, I think it muſt be, either, 1. Becauſe all Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters neceſſary to be known and done by Men at all Times, cannot at once be committed to Writing: Or, 2. Becauſe there cannot be ſufficient Evidence given to ſatisfie a Rational Man, that any Writing that is ſaid to be of divine Inſpiration and Authority, is indeed ſo.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It may be ſaid, That all Matters neceſſary to be known and done by Men at all Times, cannot be at once committed to Writing: Becauſe every Age of the World produces new Opinions, which whether they be erroneous or not, cannot be judged by a <hi>Criterion</hi> that was given many Ages before theſe Opinions were broached: And as the World grows older in Years, it likewiſe improves in Wickedneſs, which cannot be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained and ſuppreſſed by an old Law which was made before ſeveral Inſtances of thoſe Wickedneſſes that are now practiſed were either known or thought of. And if it were not ſo, what need would there be of ſuch a number of Books as are written in every Age to direct Men how to diſtinguiſh between Truth and
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:52663:7"/> Error, and what Opinions to fix upon in that great Variety of Opinions that are offered to them? Or what need would there be of ſo many new Laws as are daily made in every Commonwealth to reſtrain the growing Extravagances of Mankind, and to keep them within due Bounds? So that if there be any Neceſſity at all of divine Revelation to teach Men the Belief of Truth and the Practice of Righteouſneſs, it is neceſſary that there ſhould be a new and freſh Revelation made, at leaſt as often as any new Error is broached, or any new Piece of Villainy is practiſed in the World.</p>
                  <p>But to this Objection againſt the <hi>Sufficiency</hi> of a <hi>Standing Revelation,</hi> I ſuppoſe a full Anſwer will be given in theſe two particulars.</p>
                  <p n="1">(1.) That there is no Arguing from the Wiſdom and Power of Men, to the Wiſdom and Power of God. It may be granted to be impoſſible for a Man to write ſuch a Book as ſhall be <hi>ſufficient</hi> to confute all the Errors that can poſſibly at any time afterwards ſpring up; Or to compile ſuch a Body of Laws as ſhall be <hi>ſufficient</hi> to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent or puniſh all future Crimes; But what is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble with Men, may be poſſible with God; who has a perfect Foreſight of all the Errors that will ever be broached, and of all the Wickedneſs that will ever be practiſed by Men to the End of the World, To a Being of infinite Wiſdom and Knowledge it may be not only poſſible, but very eaſie ſo to contrive a Revelation, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned by him for the Direction of future Ages, that no Addition ſhall ever after need to be made to it. Nay indeed,</p>
                  <p n="2">(2.) The Thing it ſelf, that is, That a <hi>ſtanding Revelation</hi> ſhould be thus perfect; that it ſhould be ſo contrived at once, and at firſt, as to be <hi>ſufficient</hi> to
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:52663:7"/> anſwer all the Ends of a divine Revelation as long as the World ſhall laſt, is not very hard to be conceived.</p>
                  <p>For tho' Error be infinite, Truth, at leaſt all Truth neceſſary to be believed, is finite and limited; And after a divine Revelation is once given, no more is neceſſary to be believed in after Ages than was at firſt; nor will there ever be more things neceſſary to be believed to the End of the World, unleſs God ſhall pleaſe to add ſome new Revelation to the former. And this Revelation of all neceſſary Truth once made, being given to Men that are endued with Reaſon, nothing more is, or ever will be needful for the Diſcovery and Confutation of all Errors that can poſſibly ſpring up in after Ages, but only a right Underſtanding of the Truths already delivered, and a right Uſe of Reaſon in making Inferences, and drawing Conſequences there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from. And this is all that is pretended to by the Books of Controverſie that are written in every Age: The Deſign of them is not to declare new Truths, or to eſtabliſh new Articles of Faith, but only to ſhew that thoſe Opinions which they repreſent as falſe and erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous, are either in themſelves, or in their true Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences, contrary to ſome Maxims that are already receiv'd as true.</p>
                  <p>And it is no leſs eaſie to conceive that a <hi>ſtanding Revelation</hi> may be at once ſo contrived as to be for ever <hi>ſufficient</hi> to direct Men in all Points of <hi>Practice:</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe altho' tis poſſible that every Age may afford new Inſtances of Wickedneſs, yet the Law that they are all Tranſgreſſions of, may be but one. And the Rule once given is a perpetual Direction, not only what to do, but likewiſe what to avoid; and this, as well in thoſe Inſtances of Wickedneſs which may be invented after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, as in thoſe which were in Practice before the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:52663:8"/> Rule was made. For he that giving Direction to a Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veller in his Way, bids him <hi>keep ſtrait forward,</hi> ſhall not need, (if he ſpeaks to a Man of Reaſon) to tell him, over and above, that he muſt be careful to avoid all Turnings to the right hand or to the left; and much leſs ſhall he need to give him a particular Account of every Turning that he is to avoid. And tho' in Time to come there would be many more By-ways and Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings out of the Road than there are at preſent, yet the ſame one Direction, <hi>to keep ſtrait forward,</hi> will be as full and as ſufficient a Direction then, as it is now.</p>
                  <p>And the Neceſſity that Humane Law-givers find themſelves under to be every Day repealing former Laws and adding new Ones, is not cauſed by an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Impoſſibility of making at once ſuch a Body of Laws as might be <hi>ſufficient</hi> for all after Times; but ariſes (as I ſuppoſe) Partly from the Nature of Humane Laws, which are, for the moſt part, Negative and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibitive only; and by ſuch a Law nothing is rendred unlawful but what is named; and to name at once every thing that is then, or may be in all after Ages needful to be prohibited, would indeed be a Work of very great Difficulty; Partly, from the Nature of that Obedience that is due to a meer Humane Law, which is only an external Obedience, and to the Letter of the Law; and that indeed muſt needs be a Law, or a Body of Laws of a prodigious Bulk, and very difficult to be contrived at once, which in the Letter thereof ſhall comprehend and give Direction concerning every Action, and every Mode of Action that are neceſſary to be done or forbore, in order to the preſerving Juſtice and Peace among Men; Partly, from the little Regard that Men generally have to the good of Poſterity, which makes them only careful to contrive ſuch Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:52663:8"/> and Conſtitutions, as they hope will ſuffice to preſerve Peace in their own time, leaving it to thoſe that come after, to take the like Care for themſelves in their Times; Partly, from the Weakneſs and Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the wiſeſt of Men, who not underſtanding exactly the Tempers of all their Subjects, cannot know certainly what Effect their Laws will have, till after they have been for ſome time experienced; And partly, from the unexpected Difficulty that is ſometimes met with in the Execution of a Law, which may make it neceſſary afterwards to enforce it with a greater Penalty, or to take ſome further Care than at firſt was thought needful to ſee it executed.</p>
                  <p>But none of theſe Reaſons of the Neceſſity of new Laws among Men are of any force to ſhew that it is alſo neceſſary that God ſhould be every Day making new Declarations of his Will, and that no <hi>Standing Revelation</hi> can be <hi>ſufficient</hi> for all Times; For the Laws of God are poſitive and commanding, enjoining the trueſt and heartieſt Love both to God and Men, and every natural and proper Expreſſion thereof, and by conſequence prohibiting every Affection of Mind, and every outward Act that is contrary thereto, whether it be expreſsly named or not; And the Obedience that we owe to a divine Law, is the Obedience of the Heart and of the whole inner Man, ſuch as looks beyond the Letter to the Deſign and Intention of the Law, and avoids as carefully whatſoever is contrary to the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the Law, as if it had been forbidden in the moſt expreſs Words: And God being King for ever and ever, has the ſame Relation to all Men in all Ages, and cannot but be ſuppoſed to deſign the good Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his Subjects in after, as well as in former Times; And he alſo, underſtanding fully the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:52663:9"/> of all his Subjects, knows beforehand what Effect the Laws he gives them will have, and can never be diſappointed in his Expectation; and ſo can never be obliged to repeal or alter any of his Laws, by an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſeen Experience, that they are not ſo convenient, or ſo effectual as he thought they would be; And laſtly, He, having all Power in his Hands, and a ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign and uncontroulable Dominion over all, can ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point what Penalty he pleaſes to the Tranſgreſſion of his Laws; can at any time convict Tranſgreſſors by his own unerring Knowledge only, and the Teſtimony of their guilty Conſciences, without other Witneſſes; and has it in his own ſingle Power, without any Help of others, to execute, when-ever he will, whatever Penalty he threatens.</p>
                  <p>Thus, I think, it appears that a <hi>ſtanding Revelation</hi> may be ſo well contrived, as to be <hi>ſufficient</hi> for all Times; that all Matters neceſſary to be known and done by Men at all Times may be at once committed to Writing.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. But Secondly, Tho' this be granted, it may be ſtill further objected againſt the <hi>Sufficiency</hi> of a <hi>Stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Revelation,</hi> that it can hardly be <hi>ſufficiently</hi> atteſted; that there cannot be <hi>ſufficient</hi> Evidence given to ſatisfie a Rational Man, that any ſuch Writing, which is ſaid to be of divine Inſpiration and Authority, is indeed ſo; And that, (1.) Becauſe there is no Way, but Eye-witneſs, to be <hi>ſufficiently</hi> aſſured that any Book was written by the Perſon who is ſaid to be the Author of it; (2.) Becauſe there is no Way to be <hi>ſufficiently</hi> aſſured, that the Author of ſuch a Book did not deſign to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe upon his Readers; And (3.) Becauſe no Man can be ſure, that he himſelf was not deceived in his Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of his own Inſpiration, or of a Revelation made
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:52663:9"/> to him; or in the Truth of any other Matter which he has related as of his own Knowledge.</p>
                  <p n="1">(1.) It may be ſaid, that there is no Way but Eye-witneſs to be <hi>ſufficiently</hi> aſſured that any Book was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by the Perſon that is ſaid to be the Author of it.</p>
                  <p>But that is very ſtrange, that there ſhould be no other Way to be <hi>ſufficiently</hi> aſſured of the Author of any Book, and yet that there are a great many Books in the World, ancient as well as modern, the Authors whereof were never in the leaſt doubted of; who yet, I ſuppoſe, did not uſe to call together a Company of Men to ſtand by, and ſee them write thoſe Books which they intended to Publiſh.</p>
                  <p>It ſeems then, that either there may be, beſides Eye-witneſs, <hi>ſufficient</hi> Reaſon to believe that a Book was written by the Perſon under whoſe Name it goes; or elſe that all the World has been extremely credulous in receiving an infinite Number of Books as written by ſuch and ſuch Authors, without <hi>ſufficient</hi> Aſſurance thereof. But I believe the Truth is, There are ſome Men, who for Reaſons beſt known to themſelves, (but which may, ſome of them be eaſily enough gueſſed at) will not allow that to be <hi>ſufficient</hi> Evidence that a Book was written by a Prophet or an Apoſtle, which they muſt and do allow to be <hi>ſufficient</hi> Evidence in any other Caſe of the like Nature.</p>
                  <p>For in other Caſes we make no Doubt to receive a Book as written by ſuch an Author, if he owns himſelf to be the Author of it; or if it be ſhewn written with his own Hand; or if they that are the Publiſhers of it, declare that they had it from him, as his own; or that they tranſcribed or printed it from a Copy which they knew to be of his Hand-writing; or if it paſſes cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent in common Fame and Report to be his, and his
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:52663:10"/> moſt intimate friends believe it ſo, and he himſelf does not diſown it, and there be none elſe that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend any Claim or Title to it. Where theſe or moſt of theſe Circumſtances do concurr, we never doubt but that the Perſon ſaid to be the Author of ſuch a Book, is ſo indeed; unleſs there be ſome very clear Reaſon, grounded upon the known Incapacity of the Perſon to write in ſuch a Language, in ſuch a Stile, concerning ſuch a Subject, or the like, whereby it may be demonſtrated, that (whoever was) he could not be the Author of it. The truth is, Now adays, (and I ſuppoſe the Caſe was much the ſame formerly) whoever is the true Author of any Book, finds very little Difficulty to make Men believe that the Book is his; the greateſt Difficulty is for a Man to conceal himſelf, in caſe he be not willing to be known to be the Author of it.</p>
                  <p>And when once a Book is generally receiv'd as written by ſuch a Perſon, (when, I ſay, 'tis thus receiv'd) in that Age in which it was firſt publiſh'd, and by thoſe that were in the beſt Capacity to inquire and to judge who was the true Author of it; they that live in after times never think it reaſonable to queſtion the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity thereof, unleſs there be, evidently, ſomething, either in the Language, Dialect or Stile; or elſe in the Matter of the Book, as in the Relation of ſome Piece of Hiſtory, the References to ſome ancient Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms, the Citations out of other Authors, or the like; by which it may be clearly made out that the Book cannot be of ſuch Antiquity as it pretends to, or could not be the Writing of that Perſon who is reported and has been commonly taken to be the Author of it.</p>
                  <p>Upon ſuch Reaſons as theſe, a great many Books are every Day received as written by ſuch and ſuch Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors;
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:52663:10"/> and tho' we cannot be ſo ſure of a thing that we believe upon theſe Inducements, as we are of what we ſee with our own Eyes; yet ſuch Reaſons as theſe are by the general Conſent of Mankind judged to be <hi>ſufficient</hi> in a Matter of this Nature, which is hardly capable of better Proof. And for a Man to diſallow in one Caſe that ſame Evidence of the Truth of a Matter of Fact, which in other Caſes of the like kind he allows to be <hi>ſufficient;</hi> for a Man to receive a Book as written by another Perſon, and not to receive a Book as written by a Prophet or an Apoſtle, when he has as much Reaſon to receive one as the other, and no more Reaſon to reject one than the other, is not Judgment, or Diſcretion, or reaſonable Caution, but manifeſt Prejudice and Partiality. But,</p>
                  <p n="2">(2.) It was further ſaid, That tho' we might be well enough aſſured that a Book was written by the Perſon who is ſaid to be the Author of it; there is no Way to be <hi>ſufficiently</hi> aſſured that who he was the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of it did not deſign to impoſe upon his Readers.</p>
                  <p>It ſeems then, there is no Way to be <hi>ſufficiently</hi> ſatisfied that any Man is an honeſt Man, and fit to be credited; that he does not lye in every thing he ſays, and intend a Cheat in every thing he does. For if a Man may be believed in what he ſays, he may as well be believed in what he writes; And if he may be truſted in one Concern, he may be as ſafely truſted in another, unleſs good Reaſon can be ſhewed to the contrary.</p>
                  <p>But in judging of humane Nature in general, Men commonly judge of others by themſelves: What they are inclined to, they think is the Inclination of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind; what they allow themſelves in, they think others, (whatever they may pretend) make as little ſcruple of as they do; what they freely practice, they make no
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:52663:11"/> Doubt other Men would practiſe as freely, on the ſame Occaſions, and upon the ſame Inducements; So that when any Man is ſo very ſuſpectful of the Honeſty and Veracity of other Men, it gives but too juſt Ground to think that the Reaſon of his Aptneſs to diſtruſt all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, is his Conſciouſneſs of his own evil Deſigns, and of the little Regard that he himſelf has to Truth in his own Aſſertions. And if thoſe he has to deal with ſhould refuſe to give any Credit to any thing that he affirms, becauſe, according to his own declared Opinion, very little Credit can reaſonably be given to the Report and Affirmation of others, I do not ſee with what Reaſon he can blame them for ſo doing.</p>
                  <p>Not but that, after all, 'tis poſſible that a Man may ('tis doubtleſs what has been done by ſome) give out a Report, or write Book on purpoſe to deceive Mankind; But nevertheleſs, I ſay, that it ought not without very good Reaſon to be ſuſpected that this is any Man's De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign; and that we may have Aſſurance enough that a thing is not, which yet we muſt grant was poſſible to have been.— Particularly as to the Matter we are now ſpeaking of.</p>
                  <p>Firſt; In caſe the Author of any Book, or of any Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port relates a Matter of Fact, of which there are not, nor well could be, any other Witneſſes but himſelf; as if he ſays that he has received from God ſuch a Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, with order to publiſh it to the World, or that he himſelf was an Eye or Ear-witneſs that ſuch a thing was privately done or ſpoken by another; the Credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of ſuch a Report, whether written or ſpoken, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends, Partly, upon the Nature of the Report its ſelf; Partly, upon the Credit of its Author; And partly, upon the Proofs that he gives of his Honeſty and Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racity in that particular. And where there is a full
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:52663:11"/> Concurrence of all theſe, that is, When the Matter of the Report is credible in its ſelf; when its Author is a Perſon of Credit; and when he gives the beſt Proofs that can be of his Veracity in that particular; there is no Reaſon to reject his Teſtimony, there is <hi>ſufficient</hi> Reaſon to give Credit to it.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. If the Matter of his Report be credible in its ſelf. And if what he reports be, that he himſelf has receiv'd ſuch a Revelation from God, with order to publiſh it to the World; I ſay, that this Report in the general is a credible Report; becauſe it is very agreeable to the Goodneſs of God, and therefore not unlikely, that he ſhould impart to Men, by a ſpecial Revelation, ſuch things as are very uſeful for them to know, and which could not be known, or not ſo well; not ſo fully, clearly and certainly any other Way as by Revelation; and 'tis certainly not incredible, that he that has given us a Tongue to utter Words, and Skill to expreſs thereby our Thoughts to one another, ſhould have Power and Means to reveal and expreſs his own Mind in ſuch a Manner, that a Man may underſtand his Meaning; and 'tis likewiſe certainly not incredible in its ſelf, that God, intending to declare his Will to Mankind, ſhould make Uſe of the Miniſtry of a Man for this Purpoſe, and having made known his Will to one Man, give him Commiſſion to communicate the ſame to others.</p>
                  <p>If therefore there be any thing incredible in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of a divine Revelation, it muſt be in the ſpecial Matter of it. But altho' the particular Matter of any ſuch divine Revelation be ſuch a thing as we could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have found out by natural Reaſon; I ſay, it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs credible as a Matter divinely revealed; if it implies no Contradiction; if it be not contrary to na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Reaſon; if it be not repugnant to a former divine
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:52663:12"/> Revelation that is well atteſted; and if it be a Doctrine worthy of God; that is, If in its true Conſequences it has no Tendency to encourage Sin; but on the contrary, has a plain Tendency to promote the Practice of Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety, and Virtue among Men. Againſt ſuch a Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as this there can be no juſt Objection made from the Matter of it; There is no Improbability that ſuch a Thing as this ſhould be the Subject of a divine Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.</p>
                  <p>Or if what he reports be, that he himſelf was by when ſuch a thing was privately done or ſpoken by another; In this caſe the Matter of his Report is cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible in its ſelf, if what he ſays he was an Eye or Ear-witneſs of, be a proper Object of thoſe ſenſes; if it be not an impoſſible thing; if it does not imply a Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction. And in this caſe, the Difficulty, the Strange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, the Uncommonneſs of the Thing; its being a thing that was never known to be done or ſaid before, or which no account can be given of by Reaſon, or natural Cauſes, is no juſt Exception to the Truth of it. There is nothing in this kind abſolutely incredible, but what is plainly impoſſible. But,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Credibility of any Report, (ſuppoſing the Matter of it to be credible) depends, in good Meaſure, upon the Credit of its Author.</p>
                  <p>And then a Man may reaſonably be thought an Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, or a Witneſs of good Credit, in Matters of his own Knowledge, when he appears, and by all his other Words and Actions ſhews himſelf to be, grave, ſober, conſiderate, and in his right Wits; when he is a Perſon of unblemiſhed Reputation; when he was never known to lye, or feign, or deceive in other Caſes; when he gives no juſt Ground to ſuſpect that he is an intrigue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or deſigning Perſon; And laſtly, when he himſelf
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:52663:12"/> is no Party to the Cauſe, has no worldly Intereſt car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying on in it, no Deſign of Honour or Profit, or other temporal Advantage, that, to appearance, can be ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by his giving ſuch Teſtimony; when he will be neither the better if his Report be credited, nor the worſe if it be not believed. Such a Witneſs as this cannot reaſonably be excepted againſt.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. But 3dly, Even ſuch a Report made by ſuch a Perſon, is ſtill further credible, in caſe he gives alſo the beſt Proofs that can be given, or that the Caſe will bear, of his Veracity in that Particular.</p>
                  <p>And 'tis one very good Token of a Man's own firm Perſwaſion of the Truth of what he ſays, if he gives his Teſtimony in a grave and ſerious Manner, and if he appears to have at that Time a good ſenſe of Religion in his Mind. Upon which Account a Solemn Oath, by which God is called upon to witneſs the Truth of what is ſaid, is reck'ned the greateſt Aſſurance that ordinarily can be given of the Truth of any humane Teſtimony; and therefore by Evidence given upon Oath all Queſtions of the greateſt Conſequence to Men in this World are finally decided;<note place="margin">Heb. 6.16.</note> 
                     <hi>An Oath for Confirmation is to Men an End of all Strife.</hi> Seeing therefore that the great Credit that is given to an Oath, is grounded upon that ſerious Senſe of Religion which the Witneſs is ſuppoſed to have in his Mind, when he declares that he ſpeaks as in the Preſence of Almighty God; whenever there is good Evidence given by any Perſon of the ſame ſerious Senſe of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, his Teſtimony, 'tho' without the Formality of an Oath, is not leſs credible.</p>
                  <p>Again, It is a further Token of a Man's firm Belief of what he reports or affirms, in caſe, the Matter of his Report being ſuch as is naturally influential upon
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:52663:13"/> Practice, he himſelf lives and acts in all Reſpects a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeably thereto: And eſpecially, if in Conſequence thereof he declines making ſuch Gain and Profit to himſelf as 'tis probable he would have done had he been otherwiſe perſwaded; and denies himſelf thoſe worldly Pleaſures and Senſual Gratifications which other Men not ſo perſuaded, do freely allow them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in; and voluntarily undertakes ſuch Labours, and endures ſuch Hardſhips as it can hardly be ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed any Man of another Perſwaſion would undergo.</p>
                  <p>But the ſureſt Token that any Man can give of his Veracity, is perſiſting in the Evidence he has once given to the laſt; When no Promiſes of Wealth, Honour or Promotion can perſwade him to forbear ſpeaking the things which he has ſeen and heard; when being brought before Kings and Rulers, and ſtraitly threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to hold his Peace, he is thereby rather the more emboldened to ſpeak; when being racked and tortured to retract his Evidence, he continues in the midſt of the greateſt Torments to witneſs the ſame thing that he did before; And in fine, when having a certain Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect before him of loſing all that can be dear to him in this World, and even his Life its ſelf, unleſs he will either go back from what he has ſaid, or at leaſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear to repeat and confirm it; he willingly and chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ſeals his Teſtimony with his Blood.</p>
                  <p>Such Aſſurance as this we may have of the Honeſty and Veracity of a Perſon that witneſſes a thing only of his own private Knowledge; And this being the beſt we can have, he's an unreaſonable Man that deſires more, or ſays this is not ſufficient.</p>
                  <p>But Secondly, in Caſe the Author of any Book, or of any Report, relates a Thing that was done or ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken publickly, in the Sight or Hearing of many others
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:52663:13"/> beſides himſelf, we may have ſtill greater Aſſurance, of his Honeſty and Veracity, and of the Truth of the Report its ſelf; And we have ſo, (we have, I think, the the greateſt that can be,) if, after the Report is pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed, eſpecially if it be a Matter of great Conſequence to the World, it be not contradicted by any of thoſe that were preſent; and much rather, if they all, or a great many of them, agree in teſtifying the ſame thing; Eſpecially if they alſo are Perſons of the like good Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, and if they alſo give the ſame Proofs and Tokens of their Veracity that he did.</p>
                  <p>Such Evidence as this of the Veracity of any Author in what he writes, is beyond all reaſonable Exception. And therefore when many, and eſpecially when all theſe Evidences of Truth and Honeſty do concurr, I think we may be <hi>ſufficiently</hi> aſſured that he did not deſign to impoſe upon his Readers. But,</p>
                  <p n="3">(3.) If we may be well enough aſſured of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of any Book, and alſo of his Honeſty; yet, it was further objected, that this Author, whoever he was, could not be ſure that he himſelf was not deceived, in his Opinion of his own Inſpiration, or of a Revelation made to him; Or in the Truth of any other Matter of Fact which he has related as of his own Knowledge.</p>
                  <p>But, firſt, If he could not be ſure of his own Inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, or of a Revelation made to himſelf; how then could any Man now a days be ſure of the ſame, if God ſhould vouchſafe to ſpeak to us now, as 'tis ſaid he did in former times to the Prophets and other inſpir'd Men, by himſelf, or an Angel? So that this Objection, if it be well grounded, cuts off not only all reaſonable Belief of former Revelations, but likewiſe all reaſonable Belief of any Revelation that can now be made, to our ſelves or others; And 'tis to no Purpoſe to offer at any
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:52663:14"/> thing to convince thoſe of the Truth of any Revelation who are of Opinion that even the infinite Power and Wiſdom of God cannot make ſuch a Revelation of his Will to them as would be credible; ſuch as they ſhould reaſonably judge ſufficient for their Conviction.</p>
                  <p>This therefore is all that I ſhall ſay to this Part of the Objection; that if they ſuppoſe, as they ſeem to do, that Almighty God cannot any ways ſo reveal his Will to any Man, as that the Prophet himſelf can be aſſured that it is a divine Revelation; they ſuppoſe God to be of leſs Power and Skill than a Man is, who can utter his Mind in ſuch a Manner to another, that the other ſhall have no Doubt, who it is that ſpeaks, or what he means: But if they will but vouchſafe to grant, that God could now ſpeak, or otherwiſe reveal his Will, in ſuch Manner to us, as that we could not poſſibly have any Doubt, whether it was the Voice of God or an Angel or not, then I ſay there can be no Queſtion but that he might ſpeak in as plain a Manner to Men in former Times; and there is almoſt as little Queſtion but that he has done ſo.</p>
                  <p>But many (it may be ſaid) have pretended to Inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration or Revelations, and, we have Reaſon to believe, have thought themſelves inſpired, when yet the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they have ſaid they were inſpired with, or which they have ſaid has been revealed to them has been ſuch as has clearly evidenced to all rational Men the Falſity of their Pretence.</p>
                  <p>True; And ſo likewiſe many Men have thought themſelves at ſuch a Place, in ſuch a Company, hearing, ſeeing, ſpeaking or doing ſuch and ſuch things, when yet, as it proves afterwards, they have been all the while only in a Dream: But what then? Does it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low that becauſe a Man may think himſelf awake when
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:52663:14"/> he is in a Dream, he can therefore never be ſure that he is awake? And as little does it follow, that becauſe ſome Perſons of weak or diſtempered Brains have thought they have had Revelations, therefore no ſober and judicious Man in his right Wits, can ever be ſure of a Revelation.</p>
                  <p>But ſuppoſe a Man at the firſt, being (as it may well be imagined he muſt be) in a great Surprize and Aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment at the Strangeneſs and Novelty of the thing, ſhould not be very certain of the Reality of the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, ſhould not well know whether he was awake or aſleep; yet certainly the ſame ſigns which are ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient afterwards to ſatisfie other Men of the Truth of his Inſpiration or Revelation, muſt be allowed to be <hi>ſufficient</hi> to ſatisfie himſelf of the ſame thing.</p>
                  <p>And therefore, If <hi>Moſes</hi> (for inſtance) when God firſt ſpake to him in <hi>Horeb</hi> out of the burning Buſh,<note place="margin">Exod. 3.</note> was in ſome Doubt whether he was in a Trance, or awake and in his right Mind; whether he really heard a Voice, or only dream'd ſo: it can't well be ſuppoſed that he continued in the ſame Doubt afterwards, when having at God's Command, <hi>caſt his Rod upon the Ground,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Exod. 4.3, 4.</note> 
                     <hi>it became a Serpent;</hi> and having at the ſame divine Command <hi>taken it up by the Tail, it became a Rod again in his Hand:</hi> And when after that,<note place="margin">V. 6, 7.</note> by his firſt putting his Hand into his Boſom it became <hi>leprous as Snow,</hi> and after his putting it in the ſecond Time, <hi>it came out like his other Fleſh.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Or if it can be imagined that he might poſſibly take all this to be only a Continuation of his Dream; or at leaſt, might not in all this while be ſure that it was not a Dream; it is not conceiveable, however, that in all the Time that he was travelling from <hi>Horeb</hi> into <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,</hi> he ſhould not ever be ſo throughly awake as to be ſure that he was awake; and if he was, that he ſhould
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:52663:15"/> not in all that Time make ſuch Reflections upon what had paſſed, as either to perceive plainly that it had been only a Dream, or elſe to be very certain that it had not been a Dream, but a Reality.</p>
                  <p>Or if it can be conceived that his Amazement and Concern at what had happened was ſo great, that in all this Time he might not be ſo well come to himſelf, as to be ſure that he had had a true divine Revelation; yet I think it was not poſſible that he ſhould remain in the ſame Uncertainty, after he had been in <hi>Egypt</hi> for ſome while, and had wrought, not only thoſe two Miracles over again in the Sight of the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> whereby they were fully perſwaded of his divine Miſſion; but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe all the other great Signs and Wonders mentioned in the 7th. and following Chapters of <hi>Exodus,</hi> ſome of which the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> and even the <hi>Magicians</hi> themſelves could not but acknowledge <hi>were done by the Finger of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But this, It may be it will be ſaid, is proving one doubtful thing by another as doubtful, a Revelation by a Miracle: for it was further urged in the Objection, that no Author of any Book could be ſure that he was not deceived in any other Matter that he has related as of his own Knowledge; that 'tis poſſible there might be Miſtake in the Sign and Proof of the divine Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation as well as in the Revelation its ſelf; that 'tis poſſible that the Author of the Report (whether it was the Prophet himſelf, or any other Man who has repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Miracles done by the Prophet, as Matters of his own Knowledge) did imagine he ſaw things which he did not ſee, and that he heard things which he did not hear.</p>
                  <p>But if this be ſuppoſed poſſible, that any Man, and much more that ſeveral Men agreeing in the ſame Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, the Organs of whoſe Senſes were rightly diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:52663:15"/> and who by all their other Actions and Diſcourſes appeared to be ſober, and conſiderate, and judicious, ſhould yet in the Day time, and in a clear Light, and when they were ſure they were broad awake, be miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in the plaineſt Matters of Senſe; then there is no ſuch thing as Certainty in the World; Then they that make the Objection can be no more ſure of what they themſelves ſee and hear than other Men can be; And 'tis to no Purpoſe to hold an Argument with ſuch as dare not believe their own Eyes and Ears. The only ſenſe whereby, I think, ſuch Men can be convinced, muſt be Feeling: And it will be well for them if they can carry the ſame Scepticiſm with them into the other World, and when they are compaſſed about with the Flames of Hell, can be able to doubt whether it be a real or a painted fire, whether they are tormented in that Flame, or not.</p>
                  <p>Leaving theſe therefore to be convinced in the other World, as being, I think, not capable of Conviction here; I ſhall content my ſelf with having ſaid, what, I ſuppoſe, is enough to ſatisfie others, That the Witneſs of a plain Matter of Fact may be ſure of the Truth of what he witneſſes; and that 'tis poſſible for God to ſpeak ſo plainly to Men, that they may be certain they have had a divine Revelation; and that ſuch Evidence may be given of the Veracity of an Author, and of the Authority of a Book as is <hi>ſufficient</hi> to ſatisfie a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Man.</p>
                  <p>And by this, and what was ſaid before, I hope I have made it appear, that a <hi>Standing Revelation</hi> of God's Will may be ſo well contrived and ſo well atteſted as to be <hi>ſufficient</hi> to effect its Deſign, <hi>viz.</hi> to bring Men to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance. Whether the <hi>Standing Revelation</hi> which we have in the <hi>Holy Scripture</hi> be <hi>ſufficient</hi> for this Purpoſe, will be Matter of Enquiry in the next Diſcourſes.</p>
                  <pb n="24" facs="tcp:52663:16"/>
                  <p>In the mean time, what has been already ſaid may ſerve to diſpoſe us to hear without Prejudice the Arguments that may be offered to prove the <hi>ſufficiency</hi> of the <hi>Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi> For,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. If it be poſſible that there may be ſuch a <hi>Standing Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation,</hi> it is very probable that there is one; for from that natural Notion that we have of the Goodneſs of God it may be fairly argued, that he is not wanting to Men in the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Means of Salvation; and therefore, it being evident that there are not new Revelations made every Day, it may be reaſonably concluded that the Reaſon is, becauſe there is already ſome <hi>Standing Revelation</hi> of God's Will extant that is <hi>ſufficient</hi> to direct us in the Way to Happineſs. And,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. If there be already any ſuch <hi>Standing Revelation</hi> extant, it may be ſtrongly preſumed, that it is that which we have in the <hi>Holy Scripture;</hi> becauſe there is no other Book, that we know of, which has ſuch good Evidences of divine Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and Inſpiration as that has.</p>
                  <p>Let us then be prepared to inquire into the Grounds and Reaſons of the Chriſtian Faith and Religion with unpreju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diced Minds, with a ſincere Love and Deſire of Truth, and with a Reſolution to hear Reaſon and to be convinced by it.</p>
                  <p>And above all, (which indeed is the beſt Preparation for Truth, and the beſt Security againſt Error) let us in the Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity of our Hearts, apply our ſelves to God for his Help and Direction; And that our Prayer may be effectual, let us be careful to approve our ſelves to him, by a conſcientious Diſcharge of all thoſe Duties of Piety, Juſtice, Temperance and Charity, which are clearly taught even by natural Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; and be readily diſpoſed to practiſe whatever elſe we ſhall learn to be our Duty by any farther Illumination:<note place="margin">Joh. 7.17.</note> for <hi>if any Man will do his Will, he ſhall know of the Doctrine whether it be of God.</hi>

                     <p>Abraham ſaith unto him, They have Moſes and the Prophets; let them hear them</p>
                     <p>And he ſaid, Nay, father Abraham: but if one went unto them from the dead, they will repent.</p>
                     <p>And he ſaid unto him, If they hear not Moſes and the Prophets, neither will they be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded, though one roſe from the dead.</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>THE firſt thing which I propounded to do in Diſcourſing on theſe Words, was, to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to ſhew, that the preſent <hi>Standing Revelation</hi> of God's Will, contained in the <hi>Books</hi> of the <hi>Old</hi> and <hi>New Teſtament</hi> is abundantly <hi>ſufficient</hi> to perſuade Men to Repentance, if they are not unreaſonably blind and obſtinate. <hi>They have Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and the Prophets, (they have alſo Chriſt and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles,) let them hear them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And if that <hi>Standing Revelation</hi> which God hath made to us of his Will in the <hi>Holy Scriptures</hi> can upon any Account be thought <hi>inſufficient</hi> to effect this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, it muſt be, I think, either, 1. Becauſe no <hi>Standing Revelation</hi> can be <hi>ſufficient</hi> for this Purpoſe; Or, 2. Becauſe there are ſome particular <hi>Defects</hi> in that Revelation which we have in the <hi>Holy Scriptures</hi> which render it not ſo <hi>ſufficient</hi> for this Purpoſe, as 'tis poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble a <hi>Standing Revelation</hi> might be.</p>
                  <pb n="4" facs="tcp:52663:18"/>
                  <p>I have, therefore, in a former Diſcourſe upon theſe Words, endeavoured to ſhew in general, that a <hi>Stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Revelation</hi> of God's Will may be ſo well contrived, and ſo well atteſted as to be <hi>ſufficient</hi> for this Purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>I proceed now, in the ſecond place,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. To Conſider whether that <hi>Standing Revelation</hi> which we have in the <hi>Holy Scriptures,</hi> be ſuch a Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation; whether it be <hi>ſufficient</hi> to perſuade Men to Repentance, and fully to direct them in the Way to Happineſs; Or, whether there be not ſome particular <hi>Defects</hi> in this Revelation, which render it not ſo <hi>ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient</hi> for this Purpoſe as 'tis poſſible a <hi>Standing Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation</hi> might be.</p>
                  <p>And if there be any ſuch <hi>Defect</hi> in the <hi>Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> it muſt be either in the <hi>Matter</hi> of it, or in the <hi>Proof</hi> of it: And if it be in the Matter of it, it muſt be, either that it does not give us <hi>ſufficient Directions</hi> what to do, or that it does not propoſe <hi>ſufficient Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives</hi> to perſuade Men to do what it requires.</p>
                  <p>And therefore in ſpeaking to this Head, I ſhall ſhew, (1.) That the <hi>Holy Scripture</hi> gives us <hi>ſufficient Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions</hi> what to do. (2.) That the <hi>Motives</hi> which the <hi>Scripture</hi> propoſes, are <hi>ſufficient</hi> to perſuade us to do what it requires; And, (3.) That we have <hi>ſufficient Reaſon</hi> given us to convince us of the <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority</hi> of the <hi>Holy Scripture,</hi> and conſequently of all the Doctrines which are taught by it.</p>
                  <p n="1">(1.) I ſhall ſhew that the <hi>Holy Scripture</hi> gives us <hi>ſufficient Directions</hi> what to do.</p>
                  <p>And of this there can be little Doubt among thoſe that believe the divine Inſpiration and Authority of the <hi>Holy Scripture;</hi> becauſe to them its own Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:52663:18"/> of its own <hi>ſufficiency</hi> is a Proof thereof beyond all Exception. For, if, as the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſays, 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16. it be <hi>profitable for Doctrine and for Reproof, and for Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, and for Inſtruction in Rigteouſneſs;</hi> it is plainly profitable for all the Purpoſes for which we can deſire a divine Revelation. And, if, as he ſays in the next Verſe, it was given to make <hi>perfect the Man of God</hi> (that is, the Man whoſe Buſineſs it is to teach and inſtruct others;) and <hi>throughly to furniſh him unto all good Works,</hi> it cannot be <hi>deficient</hi> in delivering all ſuch <hi>Rules</hi> and <hi>Directions</hi> as are neceſſary to be given by a Paſtor to the People committed to his Care. And, if, as the ſame <hi>Apoſtle</hi> had ſaid at the 15th. Verſe of that Chapter, it be <hi>able to make us wiſe unto Salvation,</hi> we have no Reaſon to deſire to be wiſer than this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Book can make us. And if all this could truly be ſaid by the <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> before the <hi>Canon</hi> of the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> was compleated; if it could be ſaid by him of thoſe <hi>Holy Scriptures</hi> which <hi>Timothy</hi> had <hi>known from a Child,</hi> that is, of the <hi>Books</hi> of the <hi>Old Teſtament</hi> only, much more may it be now ſaid of the <hi>Books</hi> of <hi>both Teſtaments</hi> together.</p>
                  <p>But to ſpeak at large of this Point, at preſent, would be too great a Digreſſion from the Deſign of theſe <hi>Lectures,</hi> which were intended only againſt <hi>Infidels,</hi> not againſt any <hi>Sect</hi> of <hi>Chriſtians;</hi> and ſuch they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to be; ſuch (becauſe they hold the Foundation <hi>Chriſt Jeſus,</hi>) they may in Charity be allow'd to be, who do chiefly differ from us in this Article, and deny the <hi>ſufficiency</hi> of <hi>Scripture,</hi> only becauſe they are reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to maintain ſome gainful Doctrines and Practices of their own Church, which they are ſenſible have no Warrant from <hi>Scripture,</hi> and ſo can be maintained no
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:52663:19"/> other Way but by affirming that they have been deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered down to them by Tradition, and that unwritten Tradition is a neceſſary Supplement to the written Word, and of equal Authority with it.</p>
                  <p>For between us and <hi>Infidels</hi> who reject the <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> the <hi>Sufficiency</hi> of the <hi>Scripture</hi> as a <hi>Rule</hi> of Faith and Manners, is hardly Matter of Controverſie: for theſe do not reject the <hi>Scripture</hi> becauſe it teaches too little, but rather becauſe it teaches too much: becauſe it teaches Doctrines above their Reaſon, and commands ſuch Duties as they do not like to practiſe; and if it taught leſs than it does, they would be more ready to own its divine Authority.</p>
                  <p>But nevertheleſs even theſe Men (that they may leave no Stone unturned) will be ſometimes diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing upon this Point; and altho' thoſe <hi>Books</hi> of <hi>Holy Scripture</hi> which are now extant, and which are now generally receiv'd, do teach much more than they themſelves are willing to believe and practiſe, yet, that they may, as much as they can, unſettle the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of others, do not ſtick to argue againaſt the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion from this Topick, and to affirm that the <hi>Books</hi> of <hi>Holy Scripture</hi> which are now receiv'd do not contain the whole Will of God. For there were, ſay they, in former times, ſeveral other <hi>Goſpels,</hi> and <hi>Epiſtles,</hi> and other <hi>Tracts,</hi> deſigned to inſtruct Men in the Chriſtian Religion, which were written by the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> or other inſpired Men, and which were conſequently of the ſame Authority, in themſelves, with thoſe which are now receiv'd into the <hi>Canon,</hi> of which nevertheleſs we have nothing now left, but the Names and Titles, or ſome imperfect and uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Fragments; ſo that it may well be doubted, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:52663:19"/> thoſe <hi>few Books</hi> which are now remaining, are <hi>ſufficient</hi> to inſtruct us in all neceſſary Points of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and Practice. And of this Matter of Fact, there is, they ſay, ſome Evidence even from the <hi>Scripture</hi> its ſelf: For St. <hi>Luke,</hi> in the Beginning of his Goſpel, takes Notice, that <hi>many before him, had taken in Hand to ſet forth a Declaration of thoſe things which were ſurely believed among Chriſtians;</hi> that is, had written and publiſhed Narratives of the Life, Actions, Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, Preaching, Death and Reſurrection of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour. But there are no Hiſtories of this Kind, no <hi>Goſpels</hi> now extant, that were written before St. <hi>Luke</hi>'s, except only St. <hi>Matthew</hi>'s and St. <hi>Mark</hi>'s; and if there had been no more extant at that time, it would have been very improper, they ſay, for the <hi>Evangeliſt</hi> to have ſaid, that <hi>many</hi> had written upon this Subject, when he ſpake only of <hi>thoſe two.</hi> And that there was Matter enough for ſeveral ſuch Narratives (ſo that tho' they were very different <hi>Goſpels,</hi> they might never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs be all true) we are told by St. <hi>John,</hi> who wrote his <hi>Goſpel</hi> the laſt of the Four <hi>Evangeliſts,</hi> Joh. 20.30. <hi>Many other Signs truly did Jeſus in the Preſence of his Diſciples, which are not written in this Book;</hi> and again, Ch. 21. Verſ. 25. <hi>There are alſo many other things which Jeſus did, the which, if they ſhould be written every one, I ſuppoſe that even the World its ſelf could not contain the Books that ſhould be written.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now if it be true, that there were ſeveral <hi>other Books</hi> formerly extant, but which are now loſt, that were written by the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> and other inſpired Men, and conſequently by divine Inſpiration; either theſe were needleſs when written, (and it is unreaſonable to ſuppoſe that any <hi>Book</hi> written by divine Inſpiration was
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:52663:20"/> needleſs) or elſe the Loſs of theſe <hi>Books</hi> is a Loſs to Religion; and we cannot be well aſſured, that thoſe which we have now remaining do <hi>ſufficiently</hi> inſtruct us in all Points of Chriſtian Faith and Practice.</p>
                  <p>But admit the Truth of this Matter of Fact, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>more Books</hi> were written by the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> or inſpired Men, than are now extant, (which I will not now diſpute, becauſe I think it needleſs; becauſe I think it may be granted without any Prejudice to the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Cauſe; altho' there be none, or at moſt but very ſlender Evidence of it;) nay, admit more than is upon any good Grounds alledged; <hi>viz.</hi> not only that ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, but that every one of the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> and immediate Diſciples of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> every one that had heard him Preach, and had been a Witneſs of his Life and Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles and Reſurrection, and had received the Miraculous Gifts of the Holy Ghoſt, did write a diſtinct <hi>Goſpel</hi> giving an Account of ſome of the moſt remarkable Paſſages of our Saviour's Life which he had been a Witneſs of; and did likewiſe as he had Occaſion write <hi>Epiſtles</hi> or other <hi>Tracts</hi> for the Uſe and Inſtruction of the Chriſtian Church; every one of all which <hi>Books,</hi> if they were now extant, and as well atteſted as the <hi>Books</hi> of the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> are, would be of equal Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority with them, becauſe dictated by the ſame Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, by which all the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> were <hi>led into all Truth,</hi> and <hi>had all things that Jeſus had ſpoken brought to their Remembrance;</hi> yet, I ſay, it would by no Means follow from hence, either that thoſe <hi>Books</hi> which are now loſt (if indeed there are any loſt that were written by the <hi>Apoſtles</hi>) were needleſs when they were written; or that thoſe which do now remain are not <hi>ſufficient.</hi> And a very little Conſideration of the State of things
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:52663:20"/> as it was then, and as it is now, will make this which I have ſaid very plain.</p>
                  <p>For the Caſe then was thus: The Goſpel of <hi>Chriſt</hi> was to be preached to the whole World by a few Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who had been Eye-witneſſes of his Miracles, and were enabled by the Power of the Holy Ghoſt to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm their Teſtimony of him by doing the like Miracles themſelves; And that this great Work might be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed within the Term of their Life, it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary that they ſhould quickly diſperſe themſelves into all Parts of the World, one going this Way and another that, according as they had agreed among themſelves, or were directed by the Spirit; And in this Diviſion of Countries, every one had a large Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince aſſigned to him, ſo that having much Work to do in a little Time, he could not well ſtay long in one Place; And upon this account it might be very proper for him after he had preached the Goſpel in one City, and made a good number of Converts, and ordained Elders and eſtabliſhed a Chriſtian Church there, when he went thence to leave behind him in Writing the Sum of what he had before preached among them, for the Help of their Memories, for the Direction of their Paſtors, and to prevent any Miſ-repreſentation that might afterwards be made of his Doctrine by ignorant or deſigning Men; And after he was gone from thence, he might have frequent Occaſion to ſend them Letters, either to confirm them in their Faith, or to caution them againſt ſome Errors which he had heard were ſpringing up among them, or to correct ſome Fault in their Diſcipline or Manners.</p>
                  <p>By this Means, I ſay, it might well enough be (tho' there be no Evidence that it was ſo) that in the firſt
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:52663:21"/> Age of Chriſtianity, there might be, beſides occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſional <hi>Letters,</hi> as many diſtinct <hi>Goſpels</hi> as there were <hi>Apoſtles;</hi> every One writing a <hi>Goſpel</hi> for the proper Uſe of thoſe Churches which he himſelf had planted, and in the Language that was beſt known to them. And this, if it was done, might be no more than might be then neceſſary, when it was not ſo eaſy as it is now (ſince the Increaſe of Commerce and Navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, and the Invention of Printing) to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate and diſperſe the Books that are Publiſhed in one Country, to other Countries that are far diſtant. Beſides, if this could have been done then, it can't well be ſuppoſed that a <hi>Goſpel</hi> written by any <hi>other</hi> of the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> who had never been in that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince or Diviſion, and of whom they had never heard perhaps more than only his Name, ſhould be at firſt of ſo great Authority to them, as a Goſpel written by that very <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> by whoſe Miniſtry they had been converted, and of whoſe Miracles they themſelves had been Witneſſes.</p>
                  <p>Thus it might be; (and if it was ſo, it might be agreeable to the divine Wiſdom and Goodneſs ſo to order it) that before thoſe <hi>Books</hi> of the <hi>New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> which we now have could be well diſperſed, and upon good Atteſtation receiv'd in all Chriſtian Countries, ſome particular Churches, and eſpecially thoſe moſt remote from <hi>Judea,</hi> ſhould have for their preſent Uſe, <hi>other Books</hi> written by ſome <hi>other</hi> of the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> containing the ſame <hi>Form of ſound Words,</hi> and relating the ſame things concerning the Life and Doctrine of our Saviour that theſe do.</p>
                  <p>And that ſome of thoſe many <hi>Books</hi> which might be written by the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> or other inſpired Men
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:52663:21"/> upon this Subject, ſhould be loſt, is no Marvel at all: 'tis rather a Wonder (conſidering the Poverty of the firſt Chriſtians, and the conſtant Perſecutions they were then under, and the many Revolutions of Government that have been in <hi>Chriſtendom</hi> ſince that time,) that ſo many as we have now left could be preſerved for ſo many Ages before Printing was found out. And thoſe were of all the moſt like to be loſt, which were publiſhed in rude and barbarous Countries, and which were written in ſome Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage that was peculiar to one Nation only: And thoſe the moſt eaſie, and conſequently the moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable to be preſerved, which were publiſhed in the learned Part of the World, and written in the moſt learned Language then in Uſe.</p>
                  <p>But altho' a greater Number of <hi>inſpired Books</hi> than are now extant, might be neceſſary in the firſt Age of Chriſtianity; before the Chriſtian Churches, then newly planted in all Countries of the then known World, could have Communication with one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; it cannot be argued from hence that <hi>thoſe Books</hi> which we have now remaining are not <hi>ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient</hi> for the preſent Time, and for all the Time that has paſſed ſince the <hi>other Books</hi> were <hi>loſt;</hi> But rather, it may very reaſonably be preſumed, that there was nothing more, for Subſtance, in <hi>thoſe Books,</hi> which are ſuppoſed to be <hi>loſt,</hi> than there is in theſe which are now remaining; ſo that the Loſs of them may be no real Loſs or Detriment to Religion, and thoſe which remain and are now receiv'd in all Chriſtian Churches, may be abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly <hi>ſufficient</hi> to inſtruct us in all Points of Chriſtian Faith and Practice.</p>
                  <pb n="12" facs="tcp:52663:22"/>
                  <p>And there is indeed no Reaſon to think they are not, ſeeing ſome of thoſe ſingle Books which we have now, were written for this very Purpoſe, were deſigned as <hi>Compendiums</hi> of the whole Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Inſtitution: For St. <hi>Luke</hi> wrote his Goſpel, <hi>that</hi> Theophilus, <hi>might know the Certainty of thoſe things wherein he had been inſtructed;</hi> And if this was the <hi>Evangeliſt</hi>'s Deſign,<note place="margin">Luke 1.4.</note> it can't be ſuppoſed but that he thought he had put into his <hi>Goſpel</hi> what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever was neceſſary or very material: And St. <hi>John</hi> in the ſame Place where he acknowledges that he had omitted the Relation of many things which <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi> did,<note place="margin">Joh. 20.30, 31.</note> ſays that he <hi>had written</hi> the things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in <hi>his Goſpel,</hi> that Men <hi>might believe that Jeſus is the Chriſt, the Son of God, and that belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving they might have Life through his Name:</hi> By which it appears that he thought he himſelf had written enough in <hi>his Goſpel</hi> to perſuade Men to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and to direct them in the Way to eternal Life. There being therefore in thoſe <hi>Books</hi> of the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> which we now have, ſeveral Abridgments of the whole Chriſtian Doctrine, it cannot with any Reaſon be pretended, that all theſe Books together are not <hi>ſufficient</hi> fully to inſtruct us therein.</p>
                  <p>Beſides; The <hi>Goſpel</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> that was preached ſuppoſe, by St. <hi>Thomas</hi> in <hi>India,</hi> or by St. <hi>Simon</hi> in <hi>Africa,</hi> or by any other of the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> in Countries remote from <hi>Judea,</hi> or without the Bounds of the Roman Empire, was undoubtedly the very <hi>ſame Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel</hi> that was preached by St. <hi>Peter,</hi> and St. <hi>Paul,</hi> or thoſe other of the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> whoſe <hi>Books</hi> are now extant, and received by the Catholick Church; for
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:52663:22"/> they were all taught by the ſame Maſter, <hi>Chriſt;</hi> and were all enlightned by the ſame Holy Ghoſt: ſo that if any of them did, (as 'tis reported they did) write any <hi>Goſpels</hi> for the preſent Uſe of thoſe particular Churches which they had planted; tho' they might be ſomewhat different from any of the <hi>four Goſpels</hi> which we now have, in the Expreſſion, or perhaps in the Relation of ſome particular Paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of our Saviour's Life, which our <hi>Evangeliſts</hi> have omitted: (juſt as the <hi>four Goſpels</hi> which we now have, do differ from one another) yet for Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance they muſt needs have been the ſame with theſe, and with one another, if indeed they were all true Relations of the Matters of which the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors thereof had been Witneſſes; ſo that if we had them all now, they could all together teach us no other Doctrines than are taught in the <hi>Books</hi> of the <hi>New Teſtament.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Nevertheleſs, I do not deny but that if we had more Books of this Kind than we have; that if we had all the Books that were written by the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles,</hi> or their immediate Succeſſors who had been taught by them, they might be of very good Uſe to us, to help us to underſtand more readily and ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily thoſe Books which we have (as now we receive from ſome Portions of <hi>Holy Scripture,</hi> great Light, to help us to underſtand, and to put a right Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation upon others:) But perhaps it was for this very Reaſon that the Providence of God did order no more to be written, than were written, or has ſuffered thoſe to be loſt that are ſuppoſed to be loſt, that it might coſt us ſome Pains and Study to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand our Religion; that ſo our Knowledge as
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:52663:23"/> well as our Practice being in ſome Meaſure the Fruit of our own Induſtry, might be a proper Subject of Reward.</p>
                  <p>In ſhort, That there were <hi>more Books</hi> in the firſt Age of Chriſtianity, written by <hi>Apoſtles</hi> or other inſpired Men than are now extant, or than if ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant can be well proved to be of their Writing, is a Point which I believe cannot be now upon any certain Evidence either affirmed or denied: But if it be granted, I ſay however, there is no Reaſon to inferr from thence, that thoſe which we now have are not <hi>ſufficient.</hi> For if there be a God and a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, and if there be any Truth in the Scripture. Declarations of the Love of God to Mankind, and that <hi>he would have all Men to be ſaved, and to come to the Knowledge of the Truth,</hi> moſt certainly the neceſſary Means of Mens Salvation is a proper Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of the divine Care: And if ſo; it can't be thought but that the ſame good Providence which (as is now ſuppoſed) took Care for the <hi>writing</hi> of <hi>more Books</hi> when more might be neceſſary, has like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe taken Care for the <hi>Preſervation</hi> of <hi>ſo many</hi> of theſe Books as are now <hi>ſufficient.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Or if the Men we are now arguing with, will not grant that there is ſuch a particular Providence of God; yet if they will but allow that God is juſt: that he is not <hi>a hard Maſter,</hi> expecting to <hi>reap where he has not ſown,</hi> I think they muſt allow that all things neceſſary to our Salvation, not knowable by Reaſon, are taught in the <hi>Books</hi> of <hi>Holy Scripture</hi> which we now have, becauſe there are no <hi>other</hi> Books <hi>extant</hi> which we have reaſon to receive and accept as divine Revelation.</p>
                  <pb n="15" facs="tcp:52663:23"/>
                  <p>Or if they deny this, it will lie upon them to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce thoſe other <hi>Books</hi> which we ought to receive be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides theſe, and to give good Evidence to the World of their divine Authority. Which when they have done; or if they ſhall but only ſhew that there is <hi>as good</hi> Reaſon to receive them as theſe; We muſt own our ſelves to blame, if we ſhall not then take them alſo into the <hi>Canon</hi> of <hi>Scripture.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But till that ſhall be done, what hath been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſaid is enough to ſhew that the <hi>Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> is a compleat <hi>Rule</hi> both of Faith and Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. Eſpecially conſidering (as was noted before) that when-ever the <hi>Inſufficiency</hi> of <hi>Scripture</hi> in this Reſpect, is urged by thoſe who do not believe the <hi>Scripture</hi> (which are the Perſons I have now to deal with,) it can be only for Cavilling ſake: the true Reaſon of their Backwardneſs to receive it as a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Revelation, being, not becauſe it teaches not enough, but becauſe it teaches more than they are willing to believe, and commands more than they are diſpoſed to practiſe. For I cannot imagine that theſe Men do truly deſire <hi>more Duty</hi> than is laid upon them in the <hi>Books</hi> of <hi>Scripture</hi> now received by the Chriſtian Church; But what they may moſt reaſonably be thought to deſire, is, either ſome <hi>better Encouragement</hi> to undertake that diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult Task which the <hi>Scripture</hi> lays upon them, or ſome <hi>better Evidence</hi> that the <hi>Scripture</hi> is a divine Revelation.</p>
                  <p>I proceed now therefore to the ſecond thing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, which was,</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="16" facs="tcp:52663:24"/>(2.) To ſhew that the <hi>Motives</hi> which the <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> propoſes are <hi>ſufficient</hi> to perſuade Men to do what it requires.</p>
                  <p>Now <hi>Hopes</hi> and <hi>Fears</hi> are the great Springs of Action; and the greater the Good is we hope for, or the Evil we fear, the ſtronglier do they move and incline us to Action; And therefore how diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult ſoever the Undertaking be, (ſo it be but poſſible;) if the <hi>Motives</hi> are proportioned to the Difficulty, they muſt be granted to be <hi>ſufficient Inducements</hi> to undertake it.</p>
                  <p>But that the Task or Buſineſs required of us, is poſſible to be done, needs not to be proved now, becauſe it muſt be granted by thoſe who ſay they believe they ſhould be perſuaded to do what is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, if they had <hi>better Encouragement;</hi> for no <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments</hi> or <hi>Motives</hi> whatſoever can reaſonably per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade a Man to undertake a thing that he believes impoſſible.</p>
                  <p>Suppoſing it therefore poſſible; I ſay that whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Difficulty there really is, or we may apprehend there is, in a Chriſtian Life; if any <hi>Motives</hi> that could poſſibly be propoſed to us can be thought <hi>ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient</hi> to induce us to undertake it; moſt evidently, thoſe <hi>Motives</hi> which the <hi>Goſpel</hi> propoſes, are ſo; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe better or greater cannot be ſo much as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived or imagined; ſeeing both the good things which it promiſes to perſuade us to Virtue, and the evil things which it threatens to deterr us from Sin, are, as to the <hi>Matter</hi> of them, the greateſt that we are capable of enjoying or ſuffering; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently the moſt probable to raiſe our Hopes, and to excite our Fears to the higheſt Pitch.</p>
                  <pb n="17" facs="tcp:52663:24"/>
                  <p>For the Arguments that do moſt ſtrongly perſuade us to any thing, are from Intereſt; from the Profit and Advantage we ſhall reap by doing it; from the Tendency it has to make us happy; and Happineſs conſiſts in being perfectly free from all Pain and Trouble and Vexation; and in the full and free En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of whatſoever is pleaſing and delightful to us.</p>
                  <p>But now both theſe the <hi>Goſpel</hi> gives <hi>Aſſurance</hi> of to all thoſe that believe and obey it; that is, that they ſhall thereby be freed from that intolerable Pain and Miſery, which the Wicked and Unbelievers ſhall be condemned to, and alſo that they ſhall thereby be inſtated in the perfecteſt and compleateſt Happineſs both of Body and Soul; In a Happineſs far greater than any they do or can enjoy now; nay, in a Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs much greater than any they can now have ſo much as a Conception or Idea of in their Minds.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 2.9.</note> 
                     <hi>For Eye hath not ſeen, nor Ear heard, neither have entred into the Heart of Man the Things that God hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for them that love him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But there is, beſides, a <hi>remarkable Circumſtance</hi> which does much enhanſe the Value of any Good, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe much aggravate the Evil of any Pain or Miſery; <hi>viz.</hi> its <hi>Duration:</hi> For how great ſoever the Good or Evil propoſed to perſuade us to any thing, are in themſelves; yet if they be but of ſhort Continuance, if they will ſoon expire and be at an End, we reckon it not worth while to be at much Pains to obtain ſuch a ſhort-lived Good, or to avoid ſuch a tranſient Evil; But in this Reſpect alſo, the <hi>Motives</hi> both of Hope and of Fear which the <hi>Goſpel</hi> propoſes to us, do far ſurpaſs all thoſe Perſuaſives or Inducements which
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:52663:25"/> Sin can offer: for the moſt we can hope to eſcape by the Commiſſion of any Sin, is the Pain and Suffering of a few Weeks or Years, or a temporal Death; which laſt, yet, we cannot be ſo vain as to hope to eſcape clearly, for we can at moſt but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay it for a ſhort Seaſon; And on the other ſide, the greateſt Good we can propoſe to our ſelves, or ſo much as hope to obtain by any Sin, is the Pleaſure of a ſhort Life: In which Hope, Men are likewiſe very often moſt ſadly diſappointed; their ſinful Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifications commonly bringing with them, or draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after them, much more Trouble and Vexation even in this World, than the little Pleaſure they can reap from them is ſufficient to compenſate for. But if it were not ſo; If the Pleaſures of Sin were cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and ſincere; yet they are but for a Moment; They can be but ſhort, becauſe our Life its ſelf is but ſhort;<note place="margin">Jam. 4.14.</note> being (as St. <hi>James</hi> ſays) <hi>a Vapour, which appeareth for a little time, and then vaniſheth away.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But the <hi>Motives</hi> of both kinds, which the <hi>Goſpel</hi> propoſes, have in this Reſpect alſo, (that is, in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the <hi>Duration</hi> of the Good or Evil propoſed) all the Advantage that is poſſible.

                     <pb n="19" facs="tcp:52663:25"/> which the <hi>Goſpel</hi> threatens to Sin: And if theſe be not <hi>ſufficient</hi> to deterr Men from it, what can be <hi>ſufficient?</hi> What <hi>Evil</hi> can that Man be ſuppoſed to be afraid of, who is not afraid of <hi>everlaſting Burning?</hi> A <hi>greater Evil</hi> cannot be threatned; and he who is not ſcared by this, would certainly be leſs ſcared by the Threatning of a leſs Evil. And on the other ſide, <hi>Everlaſting Life; a Crown that fadeth not away; a Kingdom that cannot be moved; an eternal Weight of Glory; Fulneſs of Joy in the Preſence of God;</hi> and <hi>Pleaſures for evermore at his right Hand;</hi> theſe are the good things promiſed to Obedience; And could greater things be promiſed than theſe? could we our ſelves if we were put to deſire what we would, deſire more? and if the Promiſe of unſpeakable and everlaſting Bleſſedneſs, be not <hi>ſufficient</hi> to prevail with us to undertake a Godly and Chriſtian Life, certainly nothing can be <hi>ſufficient.</hi> If God ſhould make never ſo many Revelations of his Will to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, he could not propoſe greater Encouragement to Obedience, than he has done already in the <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel:</hi> And if thoſe good things which he has pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, do not move us, 'tis not becauſe they are not great enough to move a wiſe and conſidering Man, but becauſe we are ſo bent upon Sin that we will not give way to any Conſiderations that might ſerve to reſtrain us from it.</p>
                  <p>In a Word; The <hi>Goſpel Motives</hi> to Repentance and Obedience comprehend all that we can fear or hope for; ſo far therefore as Fears or Hopes can work upon us, there is plainly nothing wanting in that <hi>Standing Revelation</hi> that God has made of his Will, by <hi>Moſes and the Prophets,</hi> and eſpecially by <hi>Chriſt and his
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:52663:26"/> Apoſtles,</hi> to make it ſucceſsfull, that is, to perſuade Men to Repentance, if they will but hear what they ſay and give Credit to it.</p>
                  <p>But 'tis not, perhaps the <hi>Infidels</hi> will ſay, a <hi>better Rule</hi> that they Want, than the <hi>Scripture</hi> is, or <hi>better Motives</hi> to perſuade them to lead their Lives accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to it, than the <hi>Scripture</hi> propoſes; but what they chiefly want, is ſome <hi>better Evidence,</hi> ſome greater Certainty of the <hi>Truth</hi> of the <hi>Scripture.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This therefore was what I propounded to do in the next place; <hi>viz.</hi> To ſhew that we have <hi>ſufficient Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> given us to convince us of the <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi> of the <hi>Holy Scripture,</hi> and conſequently of all the Doctrines which are taught by it.</p>
                  <p>But becauſe the handling of this Point would take up too much Time, I ſhall chuſe to deferr it; and conclude this preſent Diſcourſe with an earneſt Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation to all thoſe that do ſincerely believe the Goſpel, to conſider often and ſeriouſly of thoſe <hi>great Motives</hi> which it propoſes to perſuade Men.</p>
                  <p>For tho' we live in an Age of great <hi>Infidelity;</hi> wherein ſome are bold enough to ſtrike at the very Foundation of all Religion, and to diſpute at leaſt, if not deny the moſt evident and undeniable Truths of it; and others think they pay Reſpect enough to the common Reaſon and Judgment of Mankind, if they do but grant themſelves to be <hi>Deiſts;</hi> and wherein, even among thoſe that openly profeſs the Chriſtian Religion, there is in a great many a Spice and Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture of Atheiſm and Infidelity; and tho' they do not actually disbelieve the Goſpel truths, yet they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve them ſo coldly and faintly, that their Faith may rather be called an Inclination to believe, than a full
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:52663:26"/> Perſuaſion; I ſay, even in this incredulous and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believing Age, I am nevertheleſs verily perſuaded, that for one Man that is ruin'd by <hi>Infidelity,</hi> many hundreds are ruined by <hi>Thoughtleſneſs</hi> and <hi>Inconſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi> that where there is one that is wicked, becauſe he believes nothing of the <hi>Goſpel-motives,</hi> nor that there is any ſuch Place or State as Heaven or Hell, there are a great many that do believe theſe things, and yet continue in their wicked Courſe, becauſe they never take any time ſeriouſly to conſider what Heaven and Hell are; and that vaſt, that infinite difference that there is between theſe two States; and how much it behoves them to uſe all Diligence to attain that, and to avoid this.</p>
                  <p>Leaving therefore thoſe who believe little or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of theſe things to my following Diſcourſes, wherein I hope to prove the <hi>Truth</hi> of the <hi>Goſpel Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,</hi> beyond all reaſonable Exception; I ſhall now addreſs my ſelf to you that do believe theſe things, and who, every time you meet together in the Church do repeat all the Articles of the Chriſtian Faith, and declare your Aſſent thereto. And what I would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of you is; that you would frequently think of thoſe things which you profeſs to believe, that you would meditate much and often thereupon, that you would ſeriouſly conſider the Meaning thereof.</p>
                  <p>Particularly, That <hi>Summary</hi> of the <hi>Goſpel Motives</hi> to Faith and Repentance before ſpoken of, that great and laſt Article of the Chriſtian Creed, <hi>The Life ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting;</hi> Conſider what it means, and do not content your ſelves only with ſaying every Day that you do believe an <hi>everlaſting Life after this,</hi> but meditate like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe every Day, or very frequently at leaſt, what
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:52663:27"/> an <hi>everlaſting Life</hi> is, and of what <hi>Sort</hi> and <hi>Kind</hi> that everlaſting Life will be.</p>
                  <p>Now <hi>Life</hi> is a ſtate of <hi>Senſation;</hi> By <hi>this</hi> a Living Body is diſtinguiſhed from a dead Carkaſs, that the living Body feels what is done unto it, and is affected thereby either with Pain or Pleaſure; whereas a dead Carkaſs is not capable of either, hath no Senſe or Feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of any thing. When therefore in repeating the Creed, we declare that we believe we ſhall live again, after our death, the meaning is, that we ſhall be hereafter in ſuch a State of <hi>Senſation</hi> as we are in now; that in that Life we ſhall be as <hi>ſenſible</hi> of Pain or Pleaſure, as we are in this Life.</p>
                  <p>But then, what makes the great Difference between this Life and that, is, that <hi>this</hi> is <hi>ſhort, tranſient</hi> and <hi>momentary,</hi> that if it be pleaſant, it is ſoon over, and that if it be painfull it will not laſt long; whereas <hi>that,</hi> ſuch as it is once, ſuch it will <hi>ever</hi> be; for that's the Meaning of <hi>a Life everlaſting;</hi> 'tis a Life that will <hi>never be ended;</hi> A Life that will <hi>continue to all Eternity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And now that we come to ſpeak of <hi>Eternity,</hi> tho' the Word has a fix'd Meaning; yet how are our Thoughts loſt and bewildered when we ſet our ſelves to meditate thereupon? When we ſpeak of a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand, or ten thouſand, or even of a Million of Years, we have ſome Notion of what we ſay; but when we come to multiply theſe thouſands, and Millions, by ten thouſands, or ten Millions, or by Millions of Millions, our Thoughts are not capacious enough to conceive, and our Mouths want Words to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs that infinite Length of Time which theſe Numbers do comprehend; And yet all that theſe
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:52663:27"/> Numbers denote, is nothing in Compariſon with <hi>Eternity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If the whole Sea were to run out Drop by Drop, what a prodigious Length of Time would this take up? and yet in time this would be done; and they that live for ever would live to ſee the vaſt Caverns of the Ocean without one Drop of Water left in them: And which is more yet, there would be no Part of their Eternity then ſpent, they would then be as far from dying as they were at firſt.</p>
                  <p>Or if only once in ten thouſand Years, one of the ſmalleſt Sands or Duſts were to be taken from the Earth, they that live for ever would live to ſee all this vaſt Bulk of the Earth by theſe ſlow and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perceptible Degrees wholly removed, not ſo much as a Grain or Atone of it left; Nay, and even in this prodigious, this unconceivable Length of Time, their Life would not be in the leaſt diminiſhed, they would have the ſame boundleſs Eternity ſtill before them that they had, when the firſt Sand was taken away.</p>
                  <p>But what do I ſpeak of theſe little Numbers, theſe Moments of Time, as they may truly be called, in Compariſon with Eternity? For even all thoſe Years in which the whole Earth might be removed, if only one ſingle ſmalleſt Duſt thereof were to be taken away once in ten thouſand Years, I ſay, all theſe Years may be expreſſed in Figures, in a Line of a few Inches long; But if the whole Expanſe of Heaven were written quite over with Figures from the Top to the Bottom, and from one Side to the other, even all theſe Figures, tho' ſet ſo cloſe that there was not Room left for one more, would not denote or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs <hi>Eternity;</hi> And when all theſe numberleſs Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:52663:28"/> of Years were ſpent, He that lives for ever, would be (as it were) but juſt then beginning to live; and his Sight and Proſpect of the Time before him, would be ſtill as boundleſs as ever.</p>
                  <p>Thus you ſee what is <hi>eternal Life;</hi> Or rather, you ſee what <hi>it is not;</hi> It is a Length of Time that cannot be expreſſed in Words, or ſignified by Figures, or conceived in Thought: It is a Length of Time to which all that we can have any poſitive Notion of, bears no Proportion.</p>
                  <p>And when we believe that we ſhall live <hi>ſuch a Life,</hi> after this ſhort Life is over; does it not highly behove us to think of it now; and to make the beſt Proviſion that is poſſible that we may be happy in it?</p>
                  <p>And this leads me to the other Branch of Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on this Subject, which we ought likewiſe fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently and ſeriouſly to dwell upon in our Minds; namely of <hi>what Sort</hi> and <hi>Kind</hi> this eternal Life will be.</p>
                  <p>And as 'tis <hi>Life,</hi> 'tis (as was ſaid before) a State of <hi>Senſation;</hi> and as it is an <hi>everlaſting Life,</hi> 'tis a State in which we ſhall for <hi>ever</hi> feel our ſelves, either in <hi>Pain</hi> or at <hi>Eaſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And if there were no more in it than this; tho' the <hi>Pain</hi> we ſhall then endure were the leaſt of thoſe Pains wherewith we are now afflicted, a little Pain or Aking of one Joint or Member only; Or tho' the <hi>Pleaſure</hi> we ſhall then enjoy, were one of the leaſt of thoſe Pleaſures wherewith we are now delighted; yet when we have added <hi>Eternity</hi> to theſe, what an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Difference is there between theſe two States? And how well muſt we needs think it worth all the Pains and Labour that we can take in this World, to ſecure to our ſelves a Portion in that better Sort of ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:52663:28"/> Life, in that Life in which there is no <hi>Pain,</hi> tho' there be but little <hi>Pleaſure?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But ſtill our Thoughts are ſhort; we have not yet a juſt Notion of the Difference between theſe two States. For if we believe the <hi>Scripture</hi> (and I ſpeak now to thoſe that do believe it,) <hi>that everlaſting Pain</hi> which the wicked will be condemned to, is not a light or gentle Pain; but the ſharpeſt, the acuteſt, the moſt tormenting that can be endured; and that <hi>eternal Joy</hi> which we have a good Hope of by the Goſpel, is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="26" facs="tcp:52663:29"/> certainly be concluded from thoſe Deſcriptions of theſe two States which we meet with in Scripture; that both the Torments of Hell and the Joys of Heaven, are as great as they can poſſibly be; far beyond any thing that we now feel or enjoy, or can have any Notion of; And in a Word, that as the <hi>Pain</hi> of Hell is <hi>endleſs,</hi> ſo it is likewiſe <hi>intolerable,</hi> and that as the <hi>Joy</hi> of Heaven is <hi>perpetual,</hi> ſo it is likewiſe <hi>unſpeakable and full of Glory.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And now after this ſhort tho' very imperfect Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation of theſe two vaſtly different States of Men in that other, and everlaſting Life that will begin when this is over; I think I may fairly ask again, What God could have done more, either to deterr us from Sin, than to threaten Hell torments to thoſe that live in it; or to encourage us to Obedience, than to promiſe to thoſe that continue in well doing, the unſpeakable Happineſs of Heaven? Certainly, if theſe <hi>Motives</hi> will not prevail upon us, no other can be propoſed, that would prevail.</p>
                  <p>Nay further; Tho' I have hitherto ſpoken to you as to Chriſtians, which believe the Scripture, and that there will certainly be another Life after this, even ſuch a Life as I have been ſpeaking of, an <hi>everlaſting Life</hi> of <hi>perfect Happineſs,</hi> or <hi>extreme Miſery;</hi> yet if you have at all attended to, and are any whit affected by that Repreſentation that I have made to you, of the <hi>Pains</hi> of <hi>Hell,</hi> and of the <hi>Joys</hi> of <hi>Heaven,</hi> and of the <hi>Eternity</hi> of both; I ſhould now dare to addreſs my ſelf to you, even tho' I thought you believed very little of theſe things; and methinks I ſhould not doubt, but that I might prevail with you, and perſuade you to Repentance, by theſe <hi>Goſpel Motives</hi> of <hi>Heaven</hi> and
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:52663:29"/> 
                     <hi>Hell;</hi> even altho' the <hi>Revelation</hi> thereof were not <hi>cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi> and <hi>undoubted,</hi> altho' there were ſome <hi>juſt Reaſon</hi> to queſtion the <hi>Truth</hi> of them.</p>
                  <p>For put the Caſe that it is very <hi>uncertain</hi> whether there will be an eternal Life or no; Nay, put the Caſe that it is ten to one, that it is much more probable, that there will not be any ſuch Life after this; Yet when we conſider what <hi>Eternity</hi> is, and what a vaſt <hi>Difference</hi> there is between living in <hi>perfect Joy,</hi> and in <hi>everlaſting Burning;</hi> and when we conſider withall the <hi>Shortneſs</hi> of this preſent Life; and how <hi>little</hi> we can loſe in it by abſtaining from Sin; and how <hi>little</hi> we can ſuffer in it, by the ſtricteſt Holineſs and Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue; even the bare <hi>Poſſibility</hi> that there will be an eternal Life, tho' we had no certain Revelation, and no other very good Aſſurance given us of it, would be abundantly <hi>ſufficient</hi> to deterr us from Sin, and to ſtir us up to well-doing. For if we live well here, and there be really an eternal Life, it will be happy for us that we have made this Preparation for it; but if there ſhould indeed be no other Life after this, we ſhall be then no Loſers by what we have done; we ſhall be then in as good a Condition, as others will be in who did not believe it, nor live in Expectation of it; And all that Trouble which the Exerciſe of Piety and Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue now coſts us, is not worth ſpeaking of; it is no more than we ought in Reaſon and Prudence to be at, altho' at the ſame time we believed it to be very uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain whether there would be any ſuch eternal Life or no.</p>
                  <p>For this is what we call and account Wiſdom in all other Caſes; <hi>viz.</hi> to provide not only againſt Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties or high Probabilities, but (when it may eaſily and
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:52663:30"/> conveniently be done) even againſt <hi>Poſſibilities</hi> too. We reckon him an unwiſe Man for the World, who being in a good Way of getting, ſpends all as faſt as it comes in, when he has no preſent Need to ſpend ſo much; and lays up nothing againſt old Age, when, if he lives to it, he will be paſt his Labour, and not in a Capacity to get enough to ſupport himſelf: And yet of all thoſe that do wiſely make ſome Proviſion for old Age, not one in ten perhaps lives to it. But never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs the bare <hi>Poſſibility</hi> that a Man may live to old Age, and the very great Inconveniences that he will ſuffer, if he ſhall have nothing then to live upon, make it very adviſeable for every one of the ten, to lay up ſomewhat, (if he can do it) againſt that time; And he, of the ten, whoſe only Lot it will be to live to be old, is not a wiſer Man for making ſuch Proviſion, than the other nine are, who yet, in the Event, will be never the better for their Labour.</p>
                  <p>Put caſe therefore that there is the ſame, or even a much greater <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncertainty</hi> whether there will be an eternal Life after this; yet when we conſider <hi>what</hi> an <hi>eternal Life</hi> is; when we conſider, that if there be a Heaven, and we can procure our Portion to be there; we ſhall be happy, infinitely and unſpeakably happy to eternal Ages; And that if there be a Hell, and we do not take Care to avoid it; our Lot will be extremely miſerable, and we ſhall be <hi>tormented Day and Night, for ever and ever, in the Lake that burns with Fire and Brimſtone:</hi> And when we conſider withal, the very <hi>lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Trouble,</hi> in Compariſon, that it will coſt us to attain that and to avoid this; that 'tis but the Labour of a few Years, and that the moſt we can ſuffer by it, is the Loſs of a little Senſual Pleaſure, for which, after this
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:52663:30"/> Life is over, we ſhould be never the better; or the enduring of ſome little Pain or Hardſhip which will be ſoon over, and for which, if no Good ſhould ever come of it after this Life, we ſhall however be then never the worſe; Conſidering, I ſay, thus, the infinitely vaſt and wide Difference, that there is between being eternally happy and eternally miſerable, 'tis enough that it is <hi>poſſible,</hi> 'tis more than enough, that 'tis <hi>probable</hi> that there will be ſuch a ſtate; and if we neglect to make Proviſion for it, becauſe we are not <hi>abſolutely certain</hi> that it will be, it is plain, that we do not act ſo pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently in this, as we do in other Caſes that are of infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely leſs Moment and Concern to us; and that (as our Saviour ſays) <hi>The Children of t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap> World, are in their Generation wiſer than the Children of Light.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now this is the moſt that the profeſſed <hi>Atheiſts</hi> or <hi>Infidels</hi> can pretend; They'll ſay perhaps, that for their own parts, they do not believe the Being of a God, or a Judgment, or a Life to come; and that they do not ſee any good Reaſon to believe theſe things; foraſmuch as all the Proofs that are brought for them, do, in their Judgment, fall ſhort of Demonſtration; and they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved not to believe them, till ſuch Proof thereof ſhall be offered, as they can make no Exception againſt; not till they ſhall ſee with their own Eyes that there is a Heaven and a Hell, or till they ſhall have a Meſſenger ſent to them from thence on purpoſe to aſſure them thereof: And be it ſo as they ſay, that there is not an abſolute Certainty of the Truth of theſe things, that we have not yet ſuch a ſure Proof of them, as ocular or mathematical Demonſtration would be; yet this is the moſt they can ſay, they themſelves cannot pretend that there is any Demonſtration on the other ſide.
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:52663:31"/> They are not ſure, they ſay, that there will be <hi>another Life,</hi> or that it will be <hi>everlaſting;</hi> Well: but are they ſure that there will not be ſuch a Life? is it abſurd or impoſſible that there ſhould be ſuch a Life? this I'm ſure they can't ſay; and all that they have yet dared to ſay, is only that thoſe Proofs thereof, that we rely upon, are not, in their Opinion, <hi>ſufficient.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But ſuppoſe them as <hi>inſufficient</hi> as they can think them; yet ſtill, if they are not <hi>ſufficient</hi> to prove the <hi>Certainty,</hi> they may be ſufficient to prove the <hi>Probability</hi> of what they are brought to prove; or if not ſo; yet ſtill a future Life, if it be not <hi>certain,</hi> nay if it be not <hi>probable,</hi> however may be <hi>poſſible;</hi> And if it be only <hi>poſſible</hi> that we may <hi>live</hi> for <hi>ever;</hi> and that we may be <hi>eternally happy,</hi> or <hi>eternally miſerable;</hi> this <hi>Poſſibility</hi> alone, (conſidering what an infinite Difference there is between theſe two States,) ought in reaſon to put us upon taking the beſt Care we can, that if there be an eternal Life, we may be eternally happy in it.</p>
                  <p>But after all, our Proof of this and other great Truths of our Religion, is not ſo very weak and ſlen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der as theſe Men would repreſent it; It is indeed as good as the Nature of the thing will bear; and he's an unreaſonable Man that requires a better Proof of any thing than it is capable of.</p>
                  <p>This therefore is what I ſhould now in the next Place, proceed to do; <hi>viz.</hi> (3.) To ſhew, that there is <hi>ſufficient Reaſon</hi> to give <hi>Credit</hi> to the <hi>Scripture,</hi> wherein theſe Truths are plainly taught. But this being too large a Subject to be handled now, I have already ſaid, I would deferr it to the next Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity.</p>

                     <p>Abraham ſaith unto him, They have Moſes and the Prophets; let them hear them.</p>
                     <p>And he ſaid, Nay, father Abraham: but if one went unto them from the dead, they will repent.</p>
                     <p>And he ſaid unto him, If they hear not Moſes and the Prophets, neither will they be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded, though one roſe from the dead.</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>HAving in my firſt Diſcourſe on theſe Words endeavoured to ſhew in general, that a <hi>Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Revelation</hi> of God's Will may be ſo well contrived, and ſo well atteſted as to be <hi>ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient</hi> to perſuade Men to Repentance if they are not unreaſonably blind and obſtinate; I came the laſt time to conſider whether that <hi>Standing Revelation</hi> which we have in the <hi>Holy Scripture</hi> be ſuch a Revelation; Or whether there be not ſome particular <hi>Defects</hi> in it, which render it not ſo <hi>ſufficient</hi> for this Purpoſe, as 'tis poſſible a <hi>Standing Revelation</hi> might be.</p>
                  <p>And if there be any ſuch <hi>Defect</hi> in the <hi>Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> it muſt be, as I ſaid, either in the <hi>Matter</hi> of it, or in the <hi>Proof</hi> of it; And if in the Matter of it, it muſt be, either that it does not give <hi>ſufficient Directions</hi> what to do; Or that it does not propoſe <hi>ſufficient Motives</hi> to perſuade Men to do what it requires.</p>
                  <p>And therefore in ſpeaking to this Head, I propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to ſhew (1.) That the <hi>Holy Scripture</hi> gives us <hi>ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:52663:33"/> Directions</hi> what to do. (2.) That the <hi>Motives</hi> which it propoſes are <hi>ſufficient</hi> to perſuade us to do what it requires: And (3.) That we have <hi>ſufficient Reaſon</hi> given us, to convince us of the <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority</hi> of the <hi>Holy Scripture,</hi> and conſequently of all the Doctrines that are taught by it.</p>
                  <p>And the Two firſt of theſe I have already done. I proceed now to the Third, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">(3.) To ſhew that we have <hi>ſufficient Reaſon</hi> given us to convince us of the <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Authority</hi> of the <hi>Holy Scripture,</hi> and conſequently of all the Doctrines that are taught by it; And that I ſhall preſume to be <hi>ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Reaſon</hi> in this Caſe, which we readily accept and allow of as <hi>ſufficient</hi> in all other Caſes of the like Nature.</p>
                  <p>And I ſuppoſe it will be granted that we have <hi>ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Proof</hi> given us of the <hi>Truth</hi> of the Things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in <hi>Holy Scripture,</hi> and of the <hi>Authority</hi> of it, if it can be ſhewn, 1. That we have <hi>ſufficient Reaſon</hi> to believe that the <hi>Books</hi> of <hi>Holy Scripture</hi> were <hi>written</hi> by thoſe <hi>Perſons</hi> who are ſaid to be the <hi>Authors</hi> thereof. 2. That there is <hi>ſufficient Reaſon</hi> to give full Credit to them in their <hi>Relation</hi> of thoſe <hi>Matters</hi> of <hi>Fact</hi> which they have recorded. And 3. That if the Matters of Fact recorded in the <hi>Scripture</hi> are true, <hi>they</hi> are <hi>ſufficient Proofs</hi> of the <hi>Truth</hi> and divine <hi>Authority</hi> of all the <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines</hi> that are therein taught.</p>
                  <p>Theſe things therefore I ſhall now endeavour to make good.</p>
                  <p>But in ſpeaking to this Point, I ſhall (for Brevity's ſake) confine my Diſcourſe only to the <hi>Books</hi> of the <hi>New Teſtament;</hi> Partly, becauſe <hi>theſe</hi> are the <hi>Books</hi> wherein our <hi>Chriſtian Religion</hi> is chiefly taught; And
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:52663:33"/> eſpecially becauſe I think there are none who receive the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> as of <hi>divine Authority,</hi> that do (or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ndeed can, with any Reaſon) reject the <hi>Old.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. Then, I am to ſhew that we have <hi>ſufficient Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> to believe that the <hi>Books</hi> of <hi>Holy Scripture,</hi> (of the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> in particular) were <hi>written</hi> by thoſe <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons</hi> that are ſaid to be the <hi>Authors</hi> thereof.</p>
                  <p>This indeed is a Point that it does not properly lie upon us to make any Proof of; For as a Man's <hi>Poſſeſſion</hi> of an Eſtate, is alone a good and a <hi>ſufficient</hi> Title to it, till a better is ſhewn by the Perſon that endeavours to eject him: ſo it is here; <hi>Theſe Books</hi> are generally receiv'd <hi>as written</hi> by ſuch and ſuch <hi>Perſons; Theſe Authors</hi> have the <hi>Name, theſe</hi> have (as it were) <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>uce any poſitive Evidence to affirm or prove their Title, their <hi>Poſſeſſion</hi> being a good Title enough, till a better appears. And a Tenant might with as good Reaſon refuſe to pay Rent to the Perſon, of whom he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ook the Eſtate, and to whom he hath ever hitherto <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="6" facs="tcp:52663:34"/> and examined, and by them make it plainly appear that he is the <hi>lawful</hi> Landlord; as any Man can now refuſe to give that Credit to <hi>theſe Books,</hi> as written by the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> which has been given hitherto, and is ſtill given by all Chriſtians, unleſs he may have now as good poſitive Evidence of their being written by the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> as might have been given thereof at firſt, and as, it may be preſumed, was given before their Title to them was ſo univerſally acknowledged.</p>
                  <p>But nevertheleſs what a Man is not under any Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation to do for the aſſerting of his Right, he may do wiſely enough for his own Satisfaction. And it muſt needs be a Satisfaction and Pleaſure to a Man, altho' his Title to his Eſtate be not at preſent contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, if in looking over the Writings and Eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of it, he ſees plainly how it deſcended to him by a lineal Succeſſion from Father to Son for many Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations paſt; and how it came at firſt to his Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors, by a clear and fair Purchaſe from the former Poſſeſſors; or by Donation from the Prince, in the Diviſion of a waſt or conquered Country; and if he alſo finds ancient Terriers agreeing in the ſame Meaſure, and Boundings, and exactly deſcribing the ſame Eſtate which he now poſſeſſes; and if moreover, looking far back, he ſees, that upon ſome Diſputes or Law-ſuits that have formerly been concerning it, Judgment has been always given on his Side. It cannot but pleaſe him, I ſay, that upon ſuch a Search into Antiquity, he finds that he is ſo very well provided to make out his Title, if there ſhould ever be any Occaſion for it; altho' by Reaſon of the long and quiet <hi>Poſſeſſion,</hi> that he, and his Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors before him, time out of Mind, have had of
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:52663:34"/> it, he has no juſt Cauſe to fear he ſhall ever meet <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>It is a further Satisfaction to us, to obſerve and conſider, that the <hi>Authority</hi> of theſe <hi>Books</hi> is as well proved as it can be, not only by oral, but alſo by the beſt <hi>written</hi> Tradition; The Chriſtian Writers of all Ages, citing them (as they had Occaſion) as the <hi>genuine Writings</hi> of the <hi>Apoſtles;</hi> And that, as well before the <hi>Canon</hi> of the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined and declared by <hi>Councils,</hi> as ſince.</p>
                  <p>And laſtly, It gives us very good Satisfaction that theſe <hi>Books</hi> are the <hi>genuine Writings</hi> of the <hi>Perſons</hi> to whom they are aſcribed, that we do not find they were ever excepted againſt, as <hi>ſpurious</hi> and <hi>coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit,</hi> in <hi>thoſe times</hi> when it would have been moſt proper to have made the Exception; and by <hi>thoſe Perſons</hi> whoſe Cauſe and Intereſt it would have ſerved very much to have proved them Spurious, if it could have been done.</p>
                  <p>For the proper <hi>time</hi> to have made this Exception to theſe Writings, was <hi>when,</hi> or <hi>ſoon after,</hi> they were firſt publiſhed; when it would have been eaſie to have proved them Spurious if they had been ſo; and no leſs eaſie to have brought poſitive Evidence of their being Genuine, if indeed they were Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine; either by the living Teſtimony of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors themſelves, or of others that knew their Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting; or by producing the original Copies under their own Hands; And therefore their being <hi>then</hi> received as the Writings of the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> by thoſe who were beſt able to know whoſe Writings they were; and their being not (for ought appears) excepted againſt, upon this Account, at <hi>that time,</hi>

                  <pb n="10" facs="tcp:52663:36"/>
                  <p>And the moſt <hi>likely Perſons,</hi> they whoſe Cauſe and Intereſt it would have ſerved moſt, to deny that theſe <hi>Books</hi> were written by the reputed <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors</hi> thereof, were the Enemies of our Religion, The <hi>Jews,</hi> or the <hi>Heathens;</hi> who neither of them wanted either Malice or Wit, to alledge any Fact that they could have juſtified the Truth of, in Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof of the Chriſtian Religion. It is therefore no ſmall Satisfaction to us to obſerve, that <hi>they</hi> never argued againſt the Chriſtian Religion from this To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pic; that <hi>they</hi> never denied that the <hi>Books</hi> which the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> received as written by the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> were <hi>genuine;</hi> Nay, that <hi>Julian</hi> himſelf, one of the ſubt'leſt, as well as of the bittereſt Adverſaries of the Chriſtian Faith, did yet expreſly own that the <hi>Books</hi> read by the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> as the Books of <hi>Peter, Paul, Matthew, Mark</hi> and <hi>Luke,</hi> were indeed theirs.</p>
                  <p>After all indeed it muſt be owned that we have not ſuch Demonſtration that the <hi>Books</hi> of the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> were written by the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> as is ſelf-evident, and cannot poſſibly be contradicted; for the Matter it ſelf is not capable of ſuch Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration. But we have ſuch Demonſtration of it as cannot be contradicted with any Reaſon; We have as good Aſſurance of it as we have, or can have, of any Matter of that kind; We have as good Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the Truth of it, as, ſuppoſing it to be true, we could have of it; and more than this cannot be deſired. We are as <hi>morally certain</hi> that <hi>theſe Books</hi> were written by the <hi>Authors</hi> to whom they are aſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, as we are that any other ancient Book was written by the Perſon who is ſaid to be the Author of it; There being no Argument, by which it is,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:52663:36"/> or can be proved, that any ancient Book was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by the Perſon who is ſaid to be the Author of it, which does not prove the Authority of <hi>theſe Books,</hi> rather more ſtrongly, than it does the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of any other Book; And there being no Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, that is, or can be urged, againſt the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of <hi>theſe Books,</hi> which may not, with as good Reaſon, be urged, to diſprove the Authority of any other Book of the like Antiquity; nay indeed, of all the Books in the World, ancient or modern, the Authors of which are not now living, or of whoſe Writing the Books aſcribed to them no living Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence can be produced.</p>
                  <p>For what is there that can be ſaid to diſprove, or to render ſuſpected the Authority of theſe Books, but only that there is a <hi>Poſſibility</hi> that Things may not be as we believe them to be? It <hi>may be,</hi> (the <hi>Atheiſt,</hi> or <hi>Infidel</hi> will ſay) that theſe Books were not written by the Perſons under whoſe Names we receive them, but by ſome others; It <hi>may be,</hi> (he'll ſay, for Inſtance:) that there never was ſuch a Man as <hi>Matthew</hi> the <hi>Publican,</hi> afterwards an <hi>Apoſtle</hi> of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> Or if there was, yet, it <hi>may be,</hi> that the <hi>Goſpel</hi> that goes under his Name was not of <hi>his</hi> Writing, but is a Book of a much later Date; It <hi>may be,</hi> that it was written by ſome crafty Prieſt, no longer ago than the laſt Age; And that he and ſome others in Confederacy with him at the ſame Time that they forged this <hi>Goſpel</hi> in the <hi>Greek Tongue,</hi> did likewiſe make and contrive all thoſe <hi>Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations</hi> of it into ſeveral Languages that are now extant, ſome of which pretend to very great Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, and which are all made with ſuch an Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:52663:37"/> of Truth, and with ſuch Congruity to the ſeveral Times in which they are ſaid to be made, that none of the Learned Men of the preſent Age have been able to diſcover the Fraud; And, It <hi>may be</hi> alſo, that when they forged the <hi>Goſpel</hi> it ſelf, they forged likewiſe all the <hi>other Books,</hi> that are pretended to be written by ſeveral Hiſtorians and Divines, in divers Languages, and in ſeveral Ages of the World for Sixteen Hundred Years paſt, in which this <hi>Goſpel</hi> is either teſtified to be written by St. <hi>Matthew,</hi> or is cited or commented upon as <hi>his;</hi> And it <hi>may be</hi> likewiſe that at the ſame Time, that they trumped up all theſe Books in one Countrey, they had their Confederates and Correſpondents that did the ſame in all the other Countries where they are now found; not only expoſing them to <hi>publick Sale</hi> as Books of ancient Date and venerable Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but likewiſe ſlily conveying an infinite Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of written and printed Copies of the ſame in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all <hi>Libraries,</hi> both publick and private, unknown to the Keepers and Owners thereof; And it <hi>may be</hi> that all theſe things were done ſo <hi>ſecretly,</hi> that none of the Confederacy did ever confeſs, nor any beſides ever diſcover the Cheat; And it <hi>may be</hi> that all the reſt of the World was ſo much <hi>aſleep</hi> at that time, as to have no Suſpicion of what was done, nor any Senſe of that great Alteration that had been made in the World by theſe Books; nor any Remembrance, afterwards, when they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woke and found themſelves <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> that they had been of ſome other Religion before, when they were firſt taken with that <hi>Lethargick Fit.</hi>

                  <p>But if theſe things <hi>may be,</hi> what is there of this kind that <hi>may not be?</hi> If the World be ſo much miſtaken in this Matter, it may be as much miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in any other Matter of the like Nature.

                  <p>Either therefore let thoſe Men who upon this Account doubt of the Authority of the <hi>Books</hi> of the <hi>New Teſtament;</hi> Or who would make others doubt of it, only by ſuggeſting that it is a thing <hi>poſſible</hi> in Nature, that they <hi>may be</hi> all <hi>forged</hi> and <hi>counterfeit,</hi> (let them, I ſay, either) entertain and ſuggeſt the ſame Doubt concerning all other ancient Books, of the Antiquity and Authority of which there is not greater Evidence than there is of theſe; And then they will render themſelves ſo juſtly ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous to the World that there will be no Need to expoſe their Folly; for then they muſt call in Queſtion the Authority of all Books and the Truth of all Hiſtory: Or elſe let them fairly own that the true Reaſon of their making a Doubt concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>theſe Books</hi> rather than concerning <hi>others,</hi> is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they do not reliſh the Matter of them; becauſe they find it eaſier to <hi>reſiſt</hi> that ſtrong Evidence that is given of the <hi>Authority</hi> of <hi>theſe Books</hi> than they do to govern their Lives according to thoſe ſtrict Rules of Holineſs and Purity that are therein pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed,

                     <pb n="18" facs="tcp:52663:41"/> Writers of theſe Books, (which ſoever they were of the Perſons before-mentioned) were of good Ability and Integrity, and well inſtructed in that Doctrine and Religion which they wrote about; And of this, beſides the Teſtimony of the Ancients, there is good Evidence enough in the Writings themſelves.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. In Anſwer to this, and to all other Objections of this ſort, againſt theſe, or any other Books, or Chapters, or Paragraphs of the New Teſtament, it hath been farther truly ſaid, that there is nothing <hi>ſingular</hi> in theſe Books, that there is no Doctrine of Chriſtianity taught in any Part of the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament of the Author or Authority of which there hath ever been any Doubt in the Church, which is not taught in ſome other undoubted and uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverted Part of the ſame Book. So that if it were granted that thoſe Parts of the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, of which there has been formerly any Doubt were ſtill of uncertain Authority, our Chriſtianity would ſuffer no real Loſs thereby; Only giving up theſe controverted Places we ſhould ſometimes want a good Help to enable us to underſtand readily thoſe other uncontroverted Places of the New Teſtament, wherein the ſame Doctrines are (but perhaps more briefly or obſcurely) delivered.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Whereas 'tis ſaid that <hi>ſome</hi> Parts of the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> have been <hi>rejected</hi> in ancient Times; This is granted. But then it hath been ſhewn, that, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering by <hi>whom</hi> they have been rejected, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der what <hi>Notion</hi> and for what <hi>Reaſons</hi> they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, this Objection is of no force to invalidate the Authority even of thoſe <hi>Parts</hi> of the <hi>New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament</hi> which have been ſo rejected, and much
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:52663:41"/> leſs of the <hi>reſt</hi> of the <hi>Book</hi> which has been <hi>allowed</hi> by all.</p>
                  <p>Thus, ſome <hi>Portions</hi> of the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> have been rejected by <hi>Hereticks,</hi> becauſe they contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted their private and ſingular Notions; Some by <hi>Judaizing Chriſtians,</hi> as the Two firſt Chapters of St. <hi>Matthew,</hi> becauſe they were not found in that <hi>Hebrew Copy</hi> of that Goſpel which they uſed; and all the <hi>Epiſtles</hi> of St. <hi>Paul</hi> were likewiſe rejected by the ſame Perſons; but not, as not written by St. <hi>Paul,</hi> but only becauſe they were written by <hi>him,</hi> whom they looked upon as an Enemy to their Nation, becauſe he levelled them with other Nations, and as too averſe to that Religion which had been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced by <hi>Moſes,</hi> which they continued ſo wedded to, even after their embracing Chriſtianity, that they could not but ſuſpect him to be a <hi>falſe Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle</hi> who had ſo plainly taught the Abrogation thereof. And for the like Reaſons <hi>ſome</hi> other <hi>Parts</hi> of the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> have been likewiſe <hi>rejected</hi> by ſome few Men; that is, not becauſe they wanted the ſame Atteſtation which the other Parts of it had, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it appeared by credible Hiſtory that they were <hi>Spurious,</hi> but only becauſe they contradicted too plainly ſome Notions which their former Prejudices or Education had made them fond of. So that this Argument againſt the Authority of the <hi>New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> taken from the <hi>Rejection</hi> of ſome <hi>Parts</hi> of it, by ſome particular <hi>Men</hi> or <hi>Sects,</hi> is manifeſtly of no Strength, unleſs there was ſome <hi>good Reaſon</hi> for their Rejecting them; And that there was <hi>good Reaſon</hi> for it, has not yet been ſhewn, but the contrary has been ſhewn very plainly by the ancient Writers
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:52663:42"/> of the Church, in ſeveral Books, (written by them in Confutation of thoſe Sects and Hereſies) which are ſtill extant.</p>
                  <p>And 3. Whereas it is further ſaid, that <hi>ſome Books</hi> which are now receiv'd as <hi>Parts</hi> of the <hi>New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> were not <hi>univerſally</hi> receiv'd in the moſt early Times, when their Authority (if they were authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick) might have been aſſerted upon more certain Grounds than it can be now; <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Epiſtle</hi> to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> the <hi>Epiſtle</hi> of St. <hi>James,</hi> the 2d. of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> the 2d. and 3d. of St. <hi>John,</hi> the <hi>Epiſtle</hi> of St. <hi>Jude,</hi> and the <hi>Book</hi> of the <hi>Revelation:</hi> This is likewiſe granted. But in Anſwer to it, it is ſaid;</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That there is good Evidence from Antiquity, that theſe <hi>controverted Books,</hi> were receiv'd in the moſt early Times, by thoſe who had the beſt Opportunity of ſatisfying themſelves of the Authors and Authority thereof, <hi>viz.</hi> by thoſe to whom they were ſent, and in general by the whole <hi>Greek Church.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. That it is no Wonder, that <hi>theſe Books</hi> (being written either to Chriſtians diſperſed, and conſequently only publiſhed by giving out Copies thereof to ſome, to be communicated, as there was Opportunity, to others; or elſe to private Perſons, living perhaps at great Diſtance from the Places from which they were ſent) were not ſo eaſie to be atteſted, and upon that Account were not at firſt ſo generally receiv'd, as the others were, which were either written to particular Churches, to which the Authors Hands, and the Meſſengers that brought them were well known, or which were firſt publiſhed and receiv'd in the ſame Places where they were written. And,</p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <pb n="21" facs="tcp:52663:42"/>3. That even <hi>thoſe Churches</hi> which did for ſome time <hi>doubt</hi> of the Authority of <hi>theſe Books,</hi> were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded at laſt to receive them as the <hi>Authentick Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings</hi> of the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> or other Inſpired Men. If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it be ſuppoſed, that while they doubted of theſe Books, they had <hi>Reaſon</hi> for their Doubt; that is, that they did it, becauſe they were not as yet fully ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied that they were <hi>Apoſtolical Writings,</hi> (which the Objectors, I believe, will readily enough grant) it may be very reaſonably preſumed, that they had af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards <hi>greater Reaſon</hi> to lay aſide their Doubt; and that when they did receive them, it was, becauſe there had been then lately ſuch Evidence and Atteſtation given of their being written by the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> or other Inſpired Men as they had not heard of before, ſuch as they could not then, with any Reaſon, contradict or gainſay; For ordinarily a leſs Reaſon will perſuade a Man to take up an Opinion at firſt, than will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade him to go back from an Opinion (how weakly ſoever grounded) which he has before embraced and defended. So that this Objection is ſo far from leſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that it rather ſtrengthens the Proof we have of the Authority even of theſe once <hi>controverted Books;</hi> And it is, beſides, a very good corroborating Evidence of the Authority of <hi>all</hi> the <hi>other Books</hi> of the <hi>New Teſtament.</hi> For the Backwardneſs of ſome Churches to receive theſe <hi>controverted Books</hi> at firſt, (when they had nothing to object to the Matter of them) makes it evident, that the Chriſtians of the firſt Ages were not ſo very eaſie and credulous as ſome have repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented them; that they did not ſo very greedily ſwallow any Book for divine Revelation that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained a great many Miracles, mixed with a few good
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:52663:43"/> Morals, without making due Enquiry concerning the Author and Authority thereof. But on the contrary, their being ſo hard to be perſuaded to receive theſe controverted Books for ſome time, while they wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, as they thought, ſufficient Atteſtation, (altho' the Doctrine of them was in all Points agreeable to the Doctrine of the other Books which they had before received; their being ſo hard, I ſay, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive theſe Books) of the Authority of which there nevertheleſs really was ſuch Evidence, as they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, after having well weighed and conſidered it, declared themſelves ſatisfied with, gives very good Ground to believe, that they had from the Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, ſuch Evidence as was without Exception of the Authority of <hi>all thoſe other Books</hi> (that is, of much the greateſt Part) of the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> which were never controverted, which were from the firſt, and with univerſal Conſent receiv'd by all Chriſtian Churches; For if there had not been very unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niable Evidence of <hi>their</hi> being the <hi>genuine</hi> Writings of the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> or other inſpired Men, there would certainly have been the ſame Doubt and Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie concerning them, that there once was concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning theſe.</p>
                  <p>But, 4. It hath been further objected, that in the early Times of Chriſtianity, there were ſeveral <hi>coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit Goſpels</hi> and <hi>Epiſtles,</hi> which paſſed among ſome for the <hi>Writings</hi> of the <hi>Apoſtles;</hi> and that 'tis poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible ſome of them may have ſlipped into the <hi>Canon,</hi> unawares to the <hi>firſt Chriſtians,</hi> who, by all the Accounts of thoſe Times, were more remarkable for their <hi>Honeſty</hi> and <hi>Simplicity</hi> and <hi>Zeal,</hi> than for their extraordinary <hi>Parts</hi> and <hi>Learning.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="23" facs="tcp:52663:43"/>
                  <p>But this Objection, (granting the Matter of Fact alledg'd in it to be true) is ſo far from <hi>leſſening,</hi> that it rather <hi>adds</hi> to that <hi>reaſonable Aſſurance</hi> that we have, that <hi>all</hi> the <hi>Books</hi> of the <hi>Canon</hi> are true and <hi>genuine.</hi> For there is nothing ſo apt to put Men upon uſing <hi>Caution,</hi> as a great Probability of being cheated if they be not cautious. Thus, when the Coin is generally good, and there is very little baſe or coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit Money ſtirring, Men commonly take it by <hi>Tale,</hi> without examining the <hi>Weight</hi> and <hi>Purity</hi> of every <hi>Piece;</hi> and ſo may more eaſily have a ſingle Piece of lighter Weight or baſer Metal put upon them without diſcerning it: But if the <hi>Coin</hi> be much cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, they look more <hi>narrowly</hi> upon every <hi>ſingle Piece</hi> of Money that they take, and if there be the leaſt Cauſe to ſuſpect it, make Trial of it by the <hi>Scale</hi> or <hi>Touchſtone,</hi> before they accept it as good. If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there were in the early Times of Chriſtianity, many <hi>counterfeit Pieces</hi> given out, and perhaps re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd by ſome, as written by the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> and which were, ſome of them, <hi>diſcovered</hi> to be <hi>ſpurious;</hi> (and there is not greater Evidence from Antiquity, that there were any ſuch <hi>ſpurious Writings,</hi> than there is that the <hi>Spuriouſneſs</hi> of ſome of them was ſoon <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd;</hi>) this could not but put the Chriſtians of thoſe Times upon examining more ſtrictly, what Evidence and Atteſtation there was that thoſe other Books were true and genuine which had been generally receiv'd as ſuch. So that the <hi>more</hi> there were of theſe <hi>ſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious</hi> and <hi>counterfeit Books,</hi> ſo much the <hi>more</hi> aſſured and confident we may reaſonably be, that none but ſuch as were <hi>undoubtedly true</hi> and <hi>authentick</hi> and very <hi>well atteſted,</hi> were admitted into the <hi>Canon;</hi> And, of
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:52663:44"/> the two, it is much more probable, that they did, for Want of <hi>clear Atteſtation,</hi> refuſe to admit ſome that had been written by the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> than that they did, without <hi>ſufficient Atteſtation,</hi> admit any that were not.</p>
                  <p>And that the Chriſtians of thoſe early Times (who had the beſt Means and Opportunities of ſatisfying themſelves whether any Book, given out as written by an <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> was ſo or not) wanted not Skill to <hi>diſcern</hi> between a <hi>true</hi> and a <hi>ſpurious</hi> Writing; (as is maliciouſly ſuggeſted by ſome Men) is abundantly evident, from thoſe <hi>Monuments</hi> of the excellent Parts and Learning of <hi>ſome</hi> of the firſt Converts to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, which are ſtill extant in their Books; and from the Teſtimony that is therein given to the like good Ability of ſeveral others, who were famous in their Generation, for their Preaching and Writings, and for their ſtoutly maintaining the Truths of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity both againſt <hi>Infidels</hi> and <hi>Hereticks,</hi> but whoſe Books are now unhappily loſt.</p>
                  <p>But 5. and laſtly; It was further ſaid; That tho' it be granted that <hi>all</hi> the <hi>Books</hi> of the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> that are now receiv'd, were <hi>originally</hi> written by the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> or other inſpired Men, yet thoſe which <hi>we</hi> now have are but <hi>Copies;</hi> in which, by ſo many <hi>Tranſcriptions</hi> thereof as muſt have been in about 1400 Years, many <hi>Alterations</hi> may have happened, thro' the <hi>Ignorance,</hi> or <hi>Overſight,</hi> or <hi>evil Deſign</hi> of the <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribers;</hi> And that ſeveral <hi>Changes</hi> have been made, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ance, in any Place of great Conſequence either Point of Hiſtory or Doctrine. For when was it
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:52663:45"/> poſſible that this Corruption ſhould be? Was it in the Copies that were given out, in the Days of the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles,</hi> and while they were living? This can't well be ſuppoſed; Or if it had been done then, it can't be thought but that the <hi>Authors</hi> of theſe Books, being <hi>living,</hi> would have taken Care to have had ſuch falſe Copies of their Books ſuppreſſed, or well corrected; or at leaſt have given publick Notice, in order to their Correction, of thoſe Faults that had been committed in the tranſcribing, which did either obſcure or ſpoil their ſenſe.</p>
                  <p>Was it then in the Times immediately <hi>after</hi> the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> were <hi>dead?</hi> But neither could this be; for by this time an infinite Number of true Copies had been made and diſperſed in all Parts of the Chriſtian Church; And beſides the <hi>Autographs</hi> of the Books themſelves were then probably, all in being; For <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian</hi> who lived in the Third Century, witneſſes that ſome of them were extant and to be ſeen even in his Time; So that by comparing of the <hi>new falſe Copies</hi> with the <hi>ancient true ones,</hi> or with the <hi>Originals</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves then extant, the Fraud would have been quickly diſcovered, or the Miſtake eaſily rectified.</p>
                  <p>Was it then in the Times after this, when the <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginals</hi> were <hi>loſt</hi> or <hi>worn out?</hi> This was ſtill leſs poſſible; For by this Time not only a greater Number of true Copies thereof, in the <hi>Original Greek,</hi> were <hi>diſperſed</hi> and in the Hands of all Chriſtians; but ſeveral <hi>Tranſlations</hi> thereof had been likewiſe made into other Languages, ſeveral <hi>Commentaries</hi> had been written thereupon, and the moſt <hi>material Paſſages</hi> thereof had been, occaſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, <hi>cited</hi> by the Chriſtian Writers of thoſe or the foregoing Times.</p>
                  <pb n="27" facs="tcp:52663:45"/>
                  <p>And the further we go on downwards, 'twas ſtill (for ſuch Reaſons as have been given already) more impoſſible that the Copies of this Book ſhould be <hi>gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally corrupted</hi> in any Place or Matter of <hi>Moment;</hi> as well as more likely that there ſhould be every Day an Increaſe of ſuch <hi>ſmall</hi> and <hi>literal Miſtakes,</hi> as could hardly be avoided by the greateſt Care and Faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. And theſe are the <hi>Various Readings</hi> before ſpoken of; Concerning which, and in Anſwer to the before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned Objection, ſo far as it is grounded upon them, it is farther ſaid—</p>
                  <p n="4">4. In the fourth Place; That <hi>they</hi> are no other than ſuch as are to be met with in Comparing the Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcripts of all other Books; That theſe <hi>various Readings</hi> (if they be compared together with Judgment) are more like to lead us to underſtand the true Meaning of the Writers, than to endanger our miſtaking their Senſe; it being very probable that when there are <hi>ſeveral Readings,</hi> one of them is the right, and eaſier by their Help, to rectifie the Miſtakes that may have been made in ſome Copies, than it would have been, if all Copies had agreed in the ſame Miſtake. And laſtly, that it is, hardly in any Place of which there are ſuch <hi>various Readings,</hi> very <hi>material</hi> which is the true Reading; there being no Point that is of the <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance</hi> either of the Hiſtory or Doctrine of Chriſtianity, that is grounded upon <hi>any Text,</hi> of which there are, in different Copies, <hi>various Readings,</hi> but which may be proved by ſome <hi>other Texts,</hi> in the Reading whereof all Copies do agree.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. And Laſtly, In Anſwer to this Objection, that the <hi>Text</hi> of the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> is depraved and <hi>corrupted,</hi> and conſequently of uncertain Authority, it is further
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:52663:46"/> ſaid; That ſuppoſing theſe Books to be written by the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> and by <hi>divine Direction</hi> and <hi>Inſpiration,</hi> (which muſt be ſuppoſed, or at leaſt, for Argument ſake, be allow'd by thoſe that make this Objection; Or elſe the Objection is trifling) it is by no Means credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that the ſame <hi>Goodneſs</hi> of <hi>God</hi> which took Care for the Writing, has not likewiſe taken Care for the <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving</hi> of theſe Books, ſo <hi>free</hi> (at leaſt) from <hi>Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> that they may be <hi>ſufficient</hi> to anſwer the Ends for which they were written; that is, fully to inſtruct Men in all Points of Chriſtian Faith and Practice, to <hi>make</hi> them <hi>wiſe unto Salvation,</hi> and <hi>throughly to furniſh</hi> them <hi>unto all good Works.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And now from all that hath been ſaid I hope it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, that we have <hi>ſufficient Reaſon</hi> to believe that the <hi>Books</hi> of the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> were written by thoſe <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons</hi> whoſe <hi>Names</hi> they bear, or to whom they are aſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, <hi>viz.</hi> by the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> or other inſpired Men; Which was the firſt thing I was to make good.</p>
                  <p>Whether there be <hi>ſufficient Reaſon</hi> to give them Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit in the <hi>Matters</hi> of <hi>Fact</hi> which they have related; and whether the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of the <hi>Goſpel</hi> be well proved by the <hi>Hiſtory</hi> of it, ſhall (God willing) be hereafter enquired.</p>
                  <p>In the mean Time (ſuppoſing their Teſtimony to be credible) what has been ſaid upon this firſt Head may ſerve to ſhew, in ſome Meaſure, the Unreaſonableneſs of thoſe Men, who are not ſatisfied with the <hi>Scripture Revelation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For I believe there are few that have heard anything of the <hi>Manner</hi> of the firſt Preaching of the Goſpel, but who think, that they that lived in thoſe Times, and heard the <hi>Apoſtles themſelves,</hi> had <hi>ſufficient Reaſon</hi> to
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:52663:46"/> receive their Teſtimony; And this (perhaps they'll ſay) is what they could with for themſelves; <hi>viz.</hi> That they might have heard the <hi>Apoſtles themſelves;</hi> or that they might now have as good and ſure Grounds of Faith as thoſe had who were converted to Chriſtianity by the Preaching of the <hi>Apoſtles;</hi> which if they had, they make no Doubt but they ſhould be, <hi>not only almoſt, but altogether ſuch,</hi> as the <hi>Primitive Chriſtians</hi> were, both in Belief and Practice.</p>
                  <p>But if they are not <hi>ſuch</hi> now, 'tis much to be doubted whether they would have been <hi>ſuch,</hi> if they had lived then. For by what has been now ſaid it appears, that the <hi>Books</hi> of the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> being (as we have very good Reaſon to believe they were) written by the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles</hi> themſelves, are <hi>their</hi> Words; <hi>their</hi> Sermons; that therein the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> themſelves <hi>being dead, do yet truly ſpeak</hi> to us, the very ſame things, tho' not juſt in the ſame Manner, that they ſpake before while they were living; and that their <hi>Teſtimony written,</hi> if indeed it be <hi>theirs,</hi> (which I have ſhewn there is no Cauſe to doubt of) is as credible as their <hi>living Teſtimony</hi> was.</p>
                  <p>For in Matters of common <hi>Teſtimony</hi> we make little Difference between <hi>Speech</hi> and <hi>Writing;</hi> If a Man whom we dare truſt ſends us a <hi>Letter,</hi> and therein relates ſuch and ſuch things, as heard or ſeen by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, or as well atteſted to him by unexceptionable Witneſſes, we give as full Credit to his <hi>Letter</hi> as we ſhould do to his <hi>Words.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So that in Truth, our Caſe, who live now, is not very different from theirs who lived in the Apoſtles Days, and <hi>heard</hi> them <hi>ſaying</hi> thoſe ſame Things, which we now <hi>read</hi> in their <hi>Books;</hi> and if we think thoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>excuſeable who did not receive their Teſtimony when
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:52663:47"/> given by <hi>Word of Mouth,</hi> we can't in good Reaſon, hold our ſelves excuſed, if we receive not the ſame Teſtimony of the ſame Perſons given <hi>under their Hands.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In one Reſpect indeed, it muſt be granted, that <hi>they</hi> had the Advantage of <hi>us; viz.</hi> becauſe they might be <hi>ſurer</hi> that they heard an <hi>Apoſtle ſpeak,</hi> than the Nature of the Thing will admit <hi>we</hi> ſhould be, that we <hi>read</hi> the <hi>Words</hi> of an <hi>Apoſtle, written;</hi> But we are ſure enough of this; We have as good <hi>moral Certainty</hi> of it, as we can have of any thing, that is not capable of any other than a <hi>moral Certainty:</hi> And if the <hi>Words</hi> that we <hi>read</hi> in the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> are the <hi>Words</hi> of the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> of <hi>Chriſt, we</hi> have, in ſome Reſpects, the Advantage of <hi>thoſe</hi> who lived in thoſe early Times; for <hi>we</hi> have the concurrent Teſtimony of <hi>ſeveral</hi> of the <hi>Apoſtles, written;</hi> whereas hardly any in thoſe times, (when a few Perſons were to bear Witneſs to all the World) could have more than the Teſtimony of one <hi>ſingle Apoſtle</hi> only, by <hi>Word of Mouth;</hi> and <hi>many</hi> Witneſſes are more credible than <hi>one;</hi> And beſides, there being <hi>ſeveral</hi> Witneſſes, their Teſtimony if it be falſe, may be more eaſily proved ſo, by their <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreement</hi> with one another, than the Teſtimony of one ſingle Witneſs could be; And laſtly, a Writing, which we may <hi>review,</hi> and <hi>read over</hi> as <hi>often</hi> as we will, and which we may take what time we pleaſe to conſider of, may be more throughly underſtood, and better digeſted, than a Sermon or Diſcourſe only <hi>once ſpoken</hi> can well be.</p>
                  <p>But if it be granted that the <hi>Faith</hi> of the firſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts to Chriſtianity, which came by <hi>Hearing</hi> of the Apoſtles, might be built upon more <hi>certain</hi> and <hi>infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible</hi>
                     <pb n="31" facs="tcp:52663:47"/> Grounds, than ours, that comes only by <hi>Reading,</hi> is; (And ſome Reaſons may perhaps be given here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, why 'twas fit it ſhould be ſo) it is enough, however, to render our Infidelity inexcuſable, if the <hi>Grounds</hi> of <hi>Faith</hi> that we now have, are very <hi>rational,</hi> if they are a <hi>ſufficient</hi> Support for ſuch a <hi>Faith</hi> as will enable us to <hi>pleaſe God,</hi> and to <hi>overcome the World.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And this may be farther ſaid for our Comfort, and to make us eaſie and ſatisfied with thoſe Grounds and Reaſons of Faith which are afforded to us by the <hi>writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten</hi> Teſtimony of the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> in the <hi>Books</hi> of the <hi>New Teſtament;</hi> that as there is <hi>more Certainty</hi> in <hi>that Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief,</hi> (if it may be called <hi>Belief</hi>) which is <hi>grounded</hi> upon <hi>Demonſtration,</hi> or <hi>infallible Evidence;</hi> ſo there is <hi>more Praiſe</hi> and <hi>Vertue</hi> in that <hi>good Diſpoſition</hi> of Mind, which makes us reſt ſatisfied with <hi>ſuch Grounds</hi> of <hi>Faith,</hi> as tho' not abſolutely and infallibly certain, yet cannot, with any good Reaſon, be <hi>denied</hi> or <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted againſt;</hi> According to that Saying of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour to St. <hi>Thomas,</hi> in a like Caſe, with which I ſhall conclude; <hi>Joh.</hi> 20.29. <hi>Thomas, becauſe thou haſt ſeen me thou haſt believed; bleſſed are they,</hi> (that is, they are more bleſſed, their Faith is more excellent and praiſe-worthy, and ſo will intitle them to a greater Reward) <hi>who have not ſeen, and yet have believed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Which Bleſſedneſs, that we may all attain, God of his great Mercy and Goodneſs grant, for the ſake of our Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

                  <p>THE Point I entred upon the Proof of the laſt time was this,</p>

                  <p>And for the Proof of this, having, for Brevity ſake, confined my Diſcourſe upon it to the <hi>Books</hi> of the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> only, (the rather becauſe the Authority of that being granted, the Authority of the <hi>Old Teſtament</hi> cannot reaſonably be queſtioned) I propounded to ſhew, 1. That we have <hi>ſufficient Reaſon</hi> to believe that the <hi>Books</hi> of the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> were written by thoſe <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons</hi> who are ſaid to be the <hi>Authors</hi> thereof. 2. That there is <hi>ſufficient Reaſon</hi> to give full <hi>Credit</hi> to <hi>them</hi> in their <hi>Relations</hi> of thoſe <hi>Matters</hi> of <hi>Fact</hi> which they have recorded. And, 3. That if the Matters of Fact related in the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> are true, <hi>they</hi> are <hi>ſufficient</hi>
                     <pb n="4" facs="tcp:52663:50"/> Proofs of the <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Divine Authority</hi> of all the <hi>Doctrines</hi> that are therein taught.</p>
                  <p>And I hope enough was ſaid the laſt time, to ſhew that we have <hi>ſufficient Reaſon</hi> to believe that the <hi>Books</hi> of the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> were written by thoſe <hi>Perſons</hi> who are ſaid to be the <hi>Authors</hi> thereof. What I am next to do, is,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. To ſhew that there is <hi>ſufficient Reaſon</hi> to give full <hi>Credit</hi> to theſe <hi>Authors</hi> in their <hi>Relations</hi> of thoſe <hi>Matters</hi> of <hi>Fact</hi> which they have recorded.</p>
                  <p>And I hope none of you that hear me (whom I preſume to be all <hi>Chriſtians</hi>) will take Offence at it, if now, while I am arguing this Point, I ſometimes ſpeak of the <hi>Holy Evangeliſts</hi> with the ſame Freedom that might be uſed in ſpeaking concerning any other Authors, and if I ſometimes Plead for no more Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit to be given to <hi>them</hi> in their Relations than is fit and reaſonable to be given to any other Hiſtorian that was naturally as well furniſhed and qualified to write a true Hiſtory as they were, and whoſe Fidelity and Veracity is as well atteſted and confirmed other Ways as theirs was. For you will conſider, I hope, that my Buſineſs is now with <hi>Infidels,</hi> with whom we can ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue only upon the Principles of common Reaſon: And tho' <hi>we</hi> who are <hi>Chriſtians</hi> already, do believe, as one of the firſt Principles of our Religion, that theſe <hi>Sacred Writers</hi> were <hi>divinely</hi> and <hi>ſupernaturally aſſiſted</hi> in their Work, and that upon that Account they deſerve much greater Credit in what they have written than other Hiſtorians do; yet this is what thoſe who are yet <hi>Infidels</hi> will not allow; And in Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſputation nothing is to be preſumed on one ſide but what will be readily allowed by the other Party. So
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:52663:50"/> that the <hi>divine Inſpiration</hi> of the <hi>Evangelical Writers</hi> and the <hi>ſupernatural Aſſiſtance</hi> which <hi>we</hi> believe they had in their Writing cannot as yet be regularly inſiſted upon as an Argument to gain them Credit; But it is what will eaſily be granted afterwards, when the Truth of their Hiſtory ſhall be well eſtabliſhed upon other Grounds; (as I hope it will be in the following Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe) and 'tis what may then ſerve to procure a <hi>religious</hi> Reſpect and Reverence to theſe Sacred Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings,<note place="margin">1 Theſſ. 2.13.</note> and to ingage us to receive them <hi>not as the Word of Men, but (as they are in Truth) as the Word of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But this one thing nevertheleſs I ſuppoſe I may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume, <hi>viz.</hi> that if the Books of the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> (the Hiſtorical Parts of it in particular) were written by thoſe Authors to whom they are aſcribed (which has been already proved) the <hi>Matters</hi> of <hi>Fact</hi> recorded by the Evangeliſts in <hi>Writing</hi> are the <hi>ſame</hi> which they and the other Apoſtles teſtified by Word of Mouth in their <hi>Preaching;</hi> For it cannot, I think, with any Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, be ſuſpected that their <hi>Preaching</hi> and <hi>Writings</hi> were <hi>diſagreeable</hi> to each other, becauſe ſuch Diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment would, moſt certainly, have utterly deſtroyed the Credit of them both.</p>
                  <p>And this being ſuppoſed, I hope, it will clearly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear that there is abundantly <hi>ſufficient Reaſon</hi> to give full <hi>Credit</hi> to theſe Writings, if theſe following things be conſidered; (1.) If we conſider the <hi>Nature, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions</hi> and <hi>Circumſtances</hi> of the <hi>Matters</hi> that are recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the <hi>Hiſtorical Books</hi> of the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> and of the <hi>Hiſtory</hi> its ſelf. (2.) If we conſider the good <hi>Capacity</hi> that the <hi>Authors</hi> thereof were in to <hi>know</hi> the <hi>Truth</hi> of the things they have related. (3.) If we
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:52663:51"/> conſider the ſtrong <hi>Obligations</hi> they were under to write nothing but the <hi>Truth,</hi> according to the beſt of their Knowledge or Information. (4.) If we conſider the good <hi>Evidences</hi> that we have of their <hi>Honeſty</hi> and <hi>Faithfulneſs.</hi> And (5.) Laſtly, If we conſider the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation</hi> that was given to the <hi>Truth</hi> of their Hiſtory by <hi>God himſelf.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. I ſay the <hi>Evangelical Hiſtory</hi> will appear to be highly credible, if (without any Regard as yet had to the Ability and Integrity of its Authors) we only conſider the <hi>Nature, Conditions</hi> and <hi>Circumſtances</hi> of the <hi>Matters</hi> therein recorded, and of the <hi>Hiſtory</hi> its ſelf. Concerning which there are two things eſpecially that may be obſerved, 1. That the <hi>Matters</hi> recorded by the <hi>Evangelical Writers</hi> are <hi>ſuch</hi> as might be <hi>cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly known.</hi> And 2.

                  <p n="1">1.

It may be further conſider'd that moſt of the things recorded by the <hi>Evangeliſts</hi> are related by them as things that were <hi>done</hi> very <hi>publickly,</hi> as things that were <hi>well known</hi> to a <hi>great many.</hi> For very few in Compariſon of thoſe <hi>Diſcourſes</hi> of our Lord that are recorded by the <hi>Evangeliſts</hi> were addreſs'd in private to his <hi>Apoſtles</hi> only, but moſt of them were ſpoken in publick; his ſet Sermons commonly to great <hi>mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes</hi> gathered together on a <hi>Mountain,</hi> on the <hi>Sea-ſhore,</hi> or in a <hi>Synagogue;</hi> and the reſt more common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in <hi>Places</hi> of <hi>Reſort,</hi> in populous Towns or Cities, in <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> or the <hi>Temple,</hi> when many were by to hear what he ſaid.

<pb n="15" facs="tcp:52663:56"/> by a great many. And even of thoſe few things which were ſpoken or done by him moſt privately, there was <hi>no want</hi> of Witneſſes; there being (except very rarely) no fewer than <hi>twelve</hi> in conſtant At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance upon him, and <hi>ſeveral</hi> others beſides that <hi>Companied with them all the time that the Lord Jeſus went in and out among them.</hi>

                  <p>And <hi>this Circumſtance</hi> of the <hi>Facts</hi> recorded by the <hi>Evangeliſts,</hi> as it made them capable of better and more certain Atteſtation, being true; ſo it contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted no leſs towards the rendring it eaſie to diſprove that Relation which they had given of them, if it had been falſe. For when a Man witneſſes a thing of his own private Knowledge there may be no way to invalidate his Teſtimony, but either by ſhewing that the thing which he teſtifies was not poſſible, or by offering ſome juſt Exception to the Credit of the Witneſs; But when neither of theſe can be done (and they cannot always be done altho' the thing te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified be falſe) yet in caſe the Matter was done pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly, it is the eaſieſt thing in the World to convict a falſe Witneſs by the <hi>contrary Teſtimony</hi> of ſeveral others that were preſent and as capable of knowing the Truth of the thing as himſelf; or by the <hi>Claſhing</hi> of the <hi>Witneſſes</hi> among themſelves. Nothing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore could have been more eaſie than to have diſpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the <hi>Evangelical Hiſtory</hi> in almoſt every particular of it, if it had not been true.</p>
                  <p>For moſt of our Saviour's Speeches and Miracles are related as ſpoken and done in the Preſence not of his Diſciples only, but of a great many others that <hi>happened</hi> to be by, by <hi>Chance,</hi> or that followed him, not for any Liking that they had to his Perſon or
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:52663:57"/> Doctrine, but only out of <hi>Curioſity,</hi> or <hi>for the Sake of the Loaves;</hi> and very often they were done before ſuch as came on purpoſe to <hi>watch</hi> what he ſaid and did, with a Deſign to lay hold on any Occaſion that was offer'd to repreſent him to the People as an <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtor.</hi> Can it be ſuppos'd then that theſe were igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant whether the Relation which the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> and <hi>Evangeliſts</hi> gave of theſe Matters was true or falſe? Or can it be imagin'd that they would all have held their Peace? that not one, of thoſe many that could have done it, would have opened his Mouth to have convicted the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> of Falſity, if they had either in Word or Writing related any one of theſe things otherwiſe than it had indeed been tranſacted? And if in any one of theſe things, of which the Apoſtles pretended they had perſonal Knowledge, they had been found <hi>falſe Witneſſes,</hi> their <hi>Credit</hi> would have been <hi>ruin'd</hi> for ever.</p>
                  <p>Nay if they had been found falſe in their Report of any of thoſe <hi>other Matters</hi> which they have left upon Record, of which they had not a perſonal Knowledge; tho' this indeed wou'd not have been ſuch a Proof of their Diſhoneſty (for any Man may very innocently be miſ-inform'd) it wou'd however have been ſuch a plain Argument of their <hi>fooliſh Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulity,</hi> as would have <hi>deſtroy'd</hi> their <hi>Credit</hi> no leſs than if they had been found in a known Lye. For theſe alſo were Matters of the ſame <hi>publick Nature;</hi> nay indeed they were rather more <hi>publick</hi> than the other; they were ſo very publick that any Man with very ſmall Trouble might have been fully ſatisfied whether they were ſo or not.</p>

                  <p>'Tis true indeed there are ſome things related by the <hi>Evangeliſts</hi> that were not altogether ſo <hi>publick</hi> as thoſe I have before mentioned, for there are ſome things, of which (according to the Account that is given of them in the <hi>Evangelical Hiſtory</hi>) none but the <hi>Diſciples</hi> of Chriſt were Witneſſes; ſuch in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular was the <hi>Reſurrection</hi> of <hi>our Lord,</hi> which we at this time commemorate; and which is for that Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon

                     <hi>he was ſeen at once by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove five hundred Brethren</hi>) their Teſtimony in this Matter, if it had been falſe, was very near as eaſie and liable to be diſproved, as in any of the Matters before ſpoken of. For it is very hard for ſo much as <hi>two Men</hi> that are hired, or agree together to give in a falſe Evidence, to be ſo well inſtructed in the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence they are to give, or to concert the Matter ſo well between themſelves, but that upon a <hi>ſeparate Examination</hi> their Falſity may eaſily be detected by their <hi>Diſagreement</hi> in ſome conſiderable Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Matter they bear Witneſs to; How very much eaſier then would it have been to have done this, in a Matter cloathed with ſuch great <hi>variety</hi> of Circumſtances, and that was teſtified by <hi>ſo many,</hi> by Twelve, by Seventy, by <hi>above five hundred Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</hi>

                  <p>Or if it can be ſuppoſed, that they might have all ſo fully agreed beforehand, in what Manner and with what Circumſtances to tell this Story, that it might not be poſſible to <hi>catch</hi> them in a <hi>Contradiction;</hi> yet the thing it ſelf was of that Nature, that the falſe Evidence they had given concerning it (if it had been falſe) might eaſily have been ſhewn other ways, for what they teſtified was that that <hi>ſame Jeſus</hi> whom the <hi>Jews</hi> had Crucified, and whom they had ſeen laid into the Sepulchre was riſen again, and had been ſeen alive three Days after his Paſſion by ſeveral of his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples; Had this therefore been falſe, how very eaſie would it have been for the <hi>Jews</hi> to have diſproved their Evidence of it, by only going to the Sepulchre, and taking out thence his <hi>dead Body,</hi> and <hi>expoſing</hi> it for ſome time to <hi>publick view?</hi> And thither doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs they did go, and with this Deſign; but the Body they could not find, and yet they had taken all the Caution that was poſſible to prevent its being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed away,<note place="margin">Mat. 27.62.</note> having obtain'd from <hi>Pilate</hi> a Guard of Soldiers on purpoſe to keep watch over it for three Days. This therefore is a ſtrong Confirmation of the Truth of the <hi>Apoſtle</hi>'s Teſtimony concerning our Lord's <hi>Reſurrection,</hi> that it being ſuch as might with the greateſt Eaſe in the World have been diſproved if it had been falſe; the <hi>Jews</hi> had nothing to ſay againſt it, nothing to oppoſe to it, but only that very ill contrived, that ſelf-contradicting Evidence of the Watchmen;<note place="margin">Mat. 29.13.</note> who ſaid that <hi>while they were aſleep,</hi> that is, when all their ſenſes were bound up, and when they were not in a Capacity of knowing any thing that was done, <hi>the Diſciples came and ſtole the Body away.</hi> But if they <hi>ſaw</hi> the Body remov'd (in which

                  <p n="6">6. Another thing that may be conſider'd in order to ſhew how very improbable, or rather how impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible it was that the <hi>Goſpel Hiſtory</hi> ſhould ever have gained Credit in the World if it had been falſe, is this; that as it was a Hiſtory of ſuch Matters and was ſo contrived that it might with the greateſt Eaſe have been diſproved, ſo the Matters therein related were in <hi>themſelves,</hi> and eſpecially in their <hi>Conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, ſuch</hi> as muſt needs have <hi>engaged</hi> a great many to <hi>make</hi> the <hi>ſtricteſt Examination</hi> that was poſſible into the Truth of them; and if they had diſcovered any thing of Falſhood therein, to <hi>make known</hi> their <hi>Diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very</hi> to the World.</p>
                  <p>For the whole <hi>Doctrine</hi> of <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> was ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon the Truth of the <hi>Evangelical Hiſtory; This</hi> diſprov'd would have deſtroy'd <hi>that,</hi> and <hi>this</hi> being admitted, there was no way to put a ſtop to the ſpreading of <hi>that;</hi> And the certain <hi>Conſequence</hi> of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the Chriſtian Religion in the World, was the Aboliſhing of all the other Forms of Religion that were then any where receiv'd or eſtabliſh'd; even of <hi>that</hi> which had been introduc'd by <hi>Moſes</hi> amongſt the <hi>Jews,</hi> by the Appointment of God himſelf, as well as of the ſeveral ſorts of <hi>Paganiſm</hi> and <hi>Idolatry</hi> that were receiv'd in other Countries.

<pb n="22" facs="tcp:52663:60"/> by the ſtrongeſt Worldly Intereſt to ſupport and maintain it. For it was not only at <hi>Epheſus</hi> that a great number of <hi>Craftsmen</hi> got their <hi>Wealth</hi> by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king <hi>Silver Shrines</hi> for <hi>Diana,</hi>

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ay have formerly been <hi>ſeveral Narratives</hi> extant
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:52663:62"/> that were perfectly contradictory to it, and thoſe too perhaps better atteſted and confirmed than the <hi>Goſpel Hiſtory</hi> was; To this I anſwer; That tis ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver allow'd to be a good Proof that a thing is, to ſay that 'tis <hi>poſſible</hi> it might be. And beſides, if this ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mize or ſuggeſtion of a thing barely poſſible be a good Objection againſt the <hi>Goſpel Hiſtory,</hi> it is as much an Objection againſt all other ancient Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; If for this Reaſon the <hi>Goſpel Hiſtory</hi> be not cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible, no other Hiſtory is ſo; for there is no ancient Hiſtory in the World now extant, which we can be ſure was never contradicted by ſome other, as ancient Hiſtory, that is not extant.</p>
                  <p>But, 2. As there is no Evidence that the <hi>Goſpel Hiſtory</hi> was contradicted when it was firſt publiſh'd, that is, when, if it had been falſe, it might moſt ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily have been diſprov'd; ſo there is on the other Side, as good <hi>Evidence</hi> as ſuch a Matter is capable of, that it never was thus <hi>contradicted</hi> or <hi>diſproved;</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe if the Facts recorded in the <hi>Evangelical Hiſtory</hi> had been then denied or diſproved by any competen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> and credible Witneſſes, 'tis impoſſible that the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Doctrine, which was grounded upon and chiefly eſtabliſhed by theſe Facts, ſhould ever have ſpread ſo faſt as by the Confeſſion of all Parties it did, from the time that it began to be preached by the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles.</hi> Nothing but the ſtrong Evidence that there was of the Truth of the <hi>Goſpel Hiſtory</hi> (and ſtrong it cannot be accounted, if there was ſtronger and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Evidence on the other ſide) could have ſupported the Profeſſion of Chriſtianity, (when it had nothing t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <pb n="27" facs="tcp:52663:62"/>
                  <p>And, 3. Whereas 'tis further ſuggeſted, that the Loſs of thoſe ancient Books which are ſuppoſed to have been written to diſprove the <hi>Goſpel Hiſtory,</hi> is owing to the Power and Subtlety of the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> of thoſe early times, who thought it beſt to <hi>ſtifle</hi> that <hi>Evidence</hi> which they could not gainſay or refute; this Suggeſtion is manifeſtly as groundleſs as 'tis ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious.</p>
                  <p>For many Books of all ſorts and of all ſides, have periſh'd by <hi>Accident,</hi> or been worn out by <hi>Time,</hi> without any formal Deſign of any Party or Perſons to ſuppreſs and deſtroy them; And I ſee no Reaſon why theſe <hi>Books</hi> written in <hi>contradiction</hi> to the <hi>Goſpel Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory</hi> (if indeed any ſuch were ever written) may not have periſhed one of theſe ways as well as many other Books have done.</p>
                  <p>Or if a <hi>Reaſon</hi> muſt needs be given why ſome Books (and why theſe in particular) have been loſt, while others of the ſame or greater Antiquity have been preſerv'd; I think the <hi>little Value</hi> that Men generally had for thoſe Books that are loſt, is the beſt Reaſon that can be given why they were ſuffered to periſh; and that the moſt probable Cauſe of Mens having ſo little value for them, was becauſe the <hi>Matter</hi> of them was ſo evidently <hi>falſe,</hi> or the <hi>Reaſoning</hi> of them ſo manifeſtly <hi>weak</hi> and <hi>fallacious,</hi> that no Man thought it worth his while to be at the Pains or Charge of getting them tranſcribed.</p>
                  <p>Or if the Men we are now arguing with will not allow this to be a good Account of the Loſs of ſuch very <hi>valuable Books</hi> as they think theſe <hi>Anti-Goſpel Hiſtories</hi> were, let them find out a better; But I'm ſure that <hi>that</hi> before ſuggeſted by them, <hi>viz.</hi> that it was
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:52663:63"/> by <hi>Deſign;</hi> the firſt <hi>Chriſtians</hi> purpoſely <hi>aboliſhing</hi> and <hi>deſtroying</hi> all <hi>Teſtimonies</hi> and <hi>Records</hi> that made againſt them, is a much worſe Account of it, and infinitely more improbable than that which I have given.</p>
                  <p>For it muſt be ſuppoſed either that theſe <hi>Anti-Goſpel Hiſtories</hi> were written very <hi>early,</hi> as ſoon al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt as the <hi>Goſpel Hiſtory</hi> was publiſhed by the Preaching or Writing of the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> or elſe in <hi>after Times;</hi> And if they were <hi>deſtroyed</hi> by the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> this muſt have been done, either <hi>ſoon after</hi> they were written, or elſe after they had been for <hi>ſome time</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd and allow'd as true Hiſtories by the Adverſaries of the Chriſtian Faith.</p>
                  <p>Now if it be ſuppos'd that theſe Books were not written till a <hi>good while after</hi> the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> had preach'd, and the <hi>Evangeliſts</hi> written the <hi>Goſpel;</hi> they were writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten <hi>too late</hi> to be of ſufficient Authority to weaken the Credit of the <hi>Goſpel-Hiſtory:</hi> For how could thoſe that were not <hi>born</hi> when the things recorded in the Goſpel were ſaid to be done, pretend to contradict the Teſtimony of thoſe who were <hi>living</hi> at that time, and who teſtified either that they ſaw them with their <hi>own Eyes,</hi> or that they receiv'd that Account of them which they publiſh'd from very <hi>credible Perſons,</hi> who ſaid they had been <hi>Eye witneſſes</hi> thereof?</p>
                  <p>But if it be ſuppoſed that theſe Books were written <hi>ſooner,</hi> even as ſoon almoſt as the <hi>Evangeliſts</hi> wrote, or the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> began to publiſh, by their Preaching, the <hi>Goſpel Hiſtory;</hi> then I ſay 'tis impoſſible they ſhould be <hi>ſuppreſs'd</hi> and <hi>deſtroy'd</hi> by the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> either <hi>then,</hi> or <hi>afterwards.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Not <hi>then;</hi> for tho' we grant that Chriſtianity
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:52663:63"/> from the very firſt Preaching of it, made a very ſwift Progreſs in the World; and from a Beginning no bigger than a Grain of Muſtard-ſeed, grew up quickly to be a goodly Tree, ſhadowing many Nations under the Branches of it; yet it did not <hi>ſpring up</hi> like a <hi>Muſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>room</hi> in a <hi>Night;</hi> it did not <hi>grow</hi> to this <hi>Bigneſs</hi> all <hi>at once.</hi> And what were the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> in the weak and infant ſtate of the Church, but an Handful of Men in Compariſon with their numberleſs Oppoſers, and thoſe too without <hi>Wealth,</hi> without <hi>Power,</hi> of no <hi>Intereſt</hi> or <hi>Eſteem</hi> in the World; that they ſhould undertake to <hi>corrupt</hi> or <hi>ſtifle</hi> the <hi>Evidence</hi> that was given againſt them, which was <hi>ſupported</hi> by the <hi>Secular Power,</hi> and gladly receiv'd and <hi>embrac'd</hi> by all <hi>other Men</hi> but them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves? What were they, that they ſhould be able to <hi>call in</hi> all the <hi>Books</hi> that had been written againſt them, and to <hi>ſuppreſs</hi> and <hi>deſtroy</hi> them at their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure? and that too ſo <hi>fully</hi> and <hi>effectually,</hi> as that with the Books themſelves which they deſtroy'd, all <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory</hi> of them ſhould likewiſe <hi>periſh?</hi> A powerful and prevailing Party, with the Government on its ſide, may indeed do much in this kind, and yet hardly ſo much as this; But they that believe the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> to have been ſuch a <hi>powerful</hi> and <hi>prevailing Party early enough</hi> to hinder the ſpreading and diſperſing of any Books that were written againſt them, believe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Ground or Warrant from Hiſtory, a more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accountable and incredible thing than any that is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded in the Goſpel.</p>
                  <p>But if this could not be done then, it might per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps be done <hi>afterwards;</hi> For in progreſs of Time 'tis certain (it may be ſaid) that the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> did come to be of very great <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Intereſt,</hi> and able to
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:52663:64"/> 
                     <hi>bear down</hi> all their <hi>Oppoſers;</hi> and 'tis likely enough that <hi>then</hi> they might ſet themſelves to <hi>deſtroy</hi> all thoſe Monuments of Antiquity whereby their <hi>fabulous Goſpels</hi> had been contradicted and diſprov'd; And 'tis not incredible that they ſhould ſo far ſucceed in their Attempt as to leave no means to Poſterity to diſcern how weak and ſandy a Foundation their Religion was built upon.</p>
                  <p>But this Suppoſition (taking it altogether) involves a greater Difficulty, and ſuppoſes a greater Miracle than the former did. For whatever the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> might attempt to do, or whatever they might be able to do, after they had attained to ſuch great Power, and were become the moſt numerous and prevailing Party; 'tis utterly incredible that they ever could have attained to ſuch great Power, that they ever could have become the moſt numerous and prevailing Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, if indeed the <hi>Goſpel Hiſtory</hi> had almoſt from the very Beginning, been oppoſed and contradicted by other Hiſtories that were more credible than the <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel Hiſtory</hi> was.</p>
                  <p>For it muſt be, and is granted by all, that at the firſt Preaching of Chriſtianity all worldly Power and Intereſt were on the other ſide, and engaged moſt ſtrongly to hinder the Growth and ſpreading of it. Now when <hi>Truth</hi> is on one ſide, and <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt</hi> on the other, 'tis not impoſſible that <hi>Truth</hi> may at laſt prevail againſt <hi>Intereſt,</hi> and bring the <hi>Power</hi> alſo to be of its ſide; But if <hi>Truth</hi> (I mean that which hath moſt Appearance of Truth, I ſay if Truth) and <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Intereſt</hi> are all on the ſame ſide from the Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning (as, it muſt be allowed, they were, by thoſe who ſay that the <hi>Goſpel Hiſtory</hi> was quickly prov'd
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:52663:64"/> falſe by other Hiſtories written and publiſh'd about the ſame time) than I ſay it is utterly impoſſible that an <hi>Impoſture</hi> quickly diſcover'd to be an <hi>Impoſture,</hi> and which ſerv'd no worldly Intereſt, ſhould ever have ſo gained ground as Chriſtianity did, againſt that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent <hi>Truth</hi> and mighty <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Intereſt</hi> that were on the other ſide. So that whatever Progreſs Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity might have made for a ſhort time at firſt, by reaſon of the Boldneſs and Confidence of its firſt Preachers, it muſt needs be that immediately from and after the Time that the <hi>Anti-Goſpel</hi> Hiſtories (of better Credit and Authority than the <hi>Goſpel Hiſtory</hi> was) were publiſh'd, it muſt have declined much faſter than it had before increaſed; and in a very few Years have ſo dwindled to nothing, that 'tis like in the Age in which we live there would hardly have been ſo much as any Remembrance of it left.</p>
                  <p>And now, if nothing more could be ſaid upon this Subject (for I have not time at preſent to take into Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration the <hi>other Proofs</hi> before hinted at of the <hi>Truth</hi> of the <hi>Goſpel-Hiſtory</hi>) I think what has been ſaid al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready is enough to ſhew that there is <hi>ſufficient Reaſon</hi> to give full <hi>Credit</hi> to the <hi>Evangelical Writers,</hi> in their <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations</hi> of thoſe <hi>Matters</hi> of <hi>Fact</hi> which they have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded; This I'm ſure of, that upon much leſs Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and Aſſurance of Truth than we have in this, we generally give Credit to other Hiſtories.</p>
                  <p>For we believe other <hi>Hiſtorians</hi> in their Relation of ſuch Matters as they could not have ſo <hi>certain Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi> or ſo <hi>good Aſſurance</hi> of as the <hi>Evangelical Writers</hi> might have of thoſe plain <hi>Matters</hi> of <hi>Fact</hi> and <hi>Senſe</hi> which they have related in <hi>their Hiſtory.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And again, we believe other <hi>Hiſtorians</hi> giving an

                  </p>
                  <p>And laſtly, If <hi>two Hiſtorians</hi> of the ſame Antiquity give different or contradictory Accounts of the ſame Matter, we do not for that Reaſon alone preſently <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject</hi> either of them; but we enquire which of them was in the <hi>beſt Capacity</hi> to know the Truth, and which of them is the leaſt <hi>liable</hi> to the <hi>ſuſpicion</hi> of <hi>falſhood,</hi> and which Story is the moſt <hi>probably related,</hi> and to the Belief of <hi>that</hi> we encline.</p>
                  <p>If therefore there be any Man that thinks there is any truth in Hiſtory, and who does give Credit to other Hiſtories, (and I believe there is no Man but does ſo) and yet will not be perſuaded to allow that the <hi>Goſpel Hiſtory</hi> is very <hi>credible,</hi> (which contains a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation only of ſuch <hi>Matters</hi> of <hi>Senſe</hi> as it was morally impoſſible there ſhould be any <hi>Cheat</hi> or <hi>Deceit</hi> in; and in which if there had been any Deceit or Miſtake it was morally impoſſible that it ſhould not be <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd</hi> and <hi>diſprov'd;</hi> and which, yet, neither is now nor ever was <hi>contradicted</hi> by any <hi>Hiſtory</hi> of compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent <hi>Antiquity</hi> and good <hi>Credit;</hi>) I think we may very well conclude, that 'tis not <hi>Reaſon</hi> or <hi>Judgment;</hi> but <hi>Prejudice,</hi> or <hi>Intereſt,</hi> or the <hi>Love</hi> of ſome <hi>Vice</hi> or <hi>Luſt</hi> that makes him an <hi>Infidel.</hi>

                     <p>Abraham ſaith unto him, They have Moſes and the Prophets; let them hear them.</p>
                     <p>And he ſaid, Nay, father Abraham: but if one went unto them from the dead, they will repent.</p>
                     <p>And he ſaid unto him, If they hear not Moſes and the Prophets, neither will they be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded, though one roſe from the dead.</p>

                  <p>THE Subject I was upon in my laſt Diſcourſe on theſe Words, and which I left unfiniſh'd, was to ſhew, That there is <hi>ſufficient Reaſon</hi> to give full <hi>Credit</hi> to the <hi>Authors</hi> of the <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorical Books</hi> of the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> in their <hi>Relations</hi> of thoſe <hi>Matters</hi> of <hi>Fact</hi> which they have recorded.</p>
                  <p>For the Proof of which I propoſed theſe following things to be conſidered; (1) The <hi>Nature, Conditions</hi> and <hi>Circumſtances</hi> of the <hi>Matters</hi> they have recorded, and of the Hiſtory its ſelf. (2) The good <hi>Capacity</hi>
                     <pb n="34" facs="tcp:52663:67"/> they were in to <hi>know</hi> the Truth of the Things they have related. (3) The ſtrong <hi>Obligations</hi> they were under to <hi>write</hi> nothing but the Truth according to the beſt of their Knowledge or Information. (4) The good <hi>Evidences</hi> that we have of their <hi>Honeſty</hi> and <hi>Faithfulneſs.</hi> And (5) Laſtly, The <hi>Confirmation</hi> that was given to the <hi>Truth</hi> of their Hiſtory by <hi>God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The laſt Diſcourſe was ſpent in the Conſideration of the firſt of theſe things. I proceed now to the Second, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">(2.) The good <hi>Capacity</hi> that the Writers of the <hi>Evangelical Hiſtory</hi> were in to <hi>know</hi> the Truth of thoſe things which they have related.</p>
                  <p>Now the Matters of Hiſtory which are related in the Epiſtles are but few, and thoſe, for the moſt part, ſuch as had been done by, or had happened to, either the Perſons that wrote them, or the Churches or Perſons to whom they were written; ſo that of theſe we ſhall not need to ſay any thing.</p>
                  <p>For the Bulk or Body of the <hi>Evangelical Hiſtory</hi> is contain'd in the <hi>Four Goſpels,</hi> and in the <hi>Acts of the Apoſtles;</hi> And of the <hi>Authors</hi> of theſe Books there is no Controverſie in the Chriſtian Church; And if they were written by the <hi>reputed Authors,</hi> a few Words will ſuffice to ſhew that <hi>they</hi> were in a very good <hi>Capacity</hi> to <hi>know</hi> the Truth of the Things they have recorded, much better than moſt other ancient Hiſtorians, whoſe Relations, nevertheleſs, are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally thought worthy of Credit.</p>
                  <p>For St. <hi>Matthew</hi> and St. <hi>John</hi> two of the four <hi>Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts</hi> were of the number of thoſe <hi>Twelve</hi> who were in conſtant Attendance upon our Lord, from the
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:52663:67"/> Time that he firſt began to preach and to make Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, until he was taken up into Heaven; ſo that they were themſelves <hi>Eye</hi> or <hi>Ear-Witneſſes</hi> of moſt of the Things which they have recorded.</p>
                  <p>Of St. <hi>Mark</hi> and St. <hi>Luke</hi> indeed the ſame cannot be ſaid; neither is it certain that they were of the Number of the Seventy Diſciples, (tho' that be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by ſome of the Ancients:) But this I think is agreed to by all; that St. <hi>Mark</hi> was for ſome part of his Life a conſtant Companion of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> who was not only one of the <hi>Twelve,</hi> but, moſt probably, the <hi>Firſt</hi> that was call'd to be an Apoſtle, and who was alſo one of the <hi>three</hi> with whom our Lord was moſt intimate and familiar (for we often read, that <hi>Peter,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Matt. 17.4.26, 37. Mark 5.37.</note> and <hi>James</hi> and <hi>John</hi> were ſingled from the reſt to be Witneſſes of ſome of the moſt private Tranſactions of his Life:) And it was generally believed in the Ancient Church, that St. <hi>Peter</hi> was more truly the Author of the <hi>Goſpel</hi> called St. <hi>Mark</hi>'s than St. <hi>Mark</hi> himſelf; <hi>He</hi> being only the <hi>Scribe</hi> or <hi>Amanuenſis,</hi> and St. <hi>Peter</hi> the Perſon that <hi>dictated</hi> the things written by him; whence alſo this Goſpel is by ſome of the Ancients ſtiled <hi>the Goſpel of St. Peter.</hi> And of this there ſeem to be ſome Tokens even in the Hiſtory its ſelf; par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly in that Relation that is therein given of St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s <hi>Denial</hi> of his Maſter, and of his <hi>Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance</hi> for it; for his <hi>Denial</hi> is there told with ſome more Circumſtances than in the other Goſpels, (ſuch as the Perſon himſelf chiefly concerned was beſt able to know and might beſt remember;) And the Account that is given of his <hi>Repentance,</hi> is by this Author ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed more modeſtly (as it beſt became a Perſon to ſpeak who ſpake of himſelf) than it is by the other
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:52663:68"/> 
                     <hi>Evangeliſts;</hi> for St. <hi>Matthew</hi> and St. <hi>Luke</hi> ſay that he wept <hi>bitterly;</hi> but St. <hi>Mark</hi> (or rather St. <hi>Peter</hi> himſelf dictating thoſe Words) only ſays, that <hi>when he thought thereon he wept.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is likewiſe agreed on all Hands that St. <hi>Luke,</hi> if not one of the Seventy Diſciples (which, 'tis moſt probable he was not) was, however a very early Convert to Chriſtianity; that he converſed frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> and immediate Diſciples of our Lord, and was a conſtant Companion of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> for a good while, in his Preaching and Travels; ſo that of almoſt all the Things which he relates in his <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory</hi> of the <hi>Acts of the Apoſtles</hi> he might be, and of much the greateſt part of them, 'tis moſt probable, and of ſome, 'tis certain, he was an <hi>Eye</hi> or <hi>Ear-Witneſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So then, There are <hi>three</hi> of the <hi>five</hi> Hiſtorical Books of the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> that were written by thoſe who were preſent at moſt of the things which they have related, (<hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Goſpels</hi> of St. <hi>Matthew</hi> and St. <hi>John,</hi> and the <hi>Acts of the Apoſtles;</hi>) and another of them tho' it bears the Name of St. <hi>Mark</hi> the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon by whom it was penned, yet if it was (as has been generally believ'd) dictated by St. <hi>Peter,</hi> may be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to that number, and be likewiſe reckon'd the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of One who was an <hi>Eye Witneſs</hi> of the things he has related.</p>
                  <p>In this Reſpect therefore the <hi>Goſpel Hiſtory</hi> is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly as credible as 'tis poſſible any Hiſtory ſhould be; for no Hiſtorian can record any thing upon bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Aſſurance of its Truth than the Evidence of his own Senſes.</p>
                  <pb n="37" facs="tcp:52663:68"/>
                  <p>But the <hi>Goſpel</hi> of St. <hi>Luke,</hi> it muſt be granted, is not of this ſort; He himſelf does not pretend that the Matters by him recorded were of his own Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; he only ſays,<note place="margin">Luke 1.2, 3.</note> 
                     <hi>He had perfect underſtanding of them from the very firſt, from thoſe who from the Beginning were Eye-witneſſes and Miniſters of the Word.</hi> And of ſome few Matters recorded by the other <hi>Evangeliſts,</hi> the ſame muſt likewiſe be granted (particularly of the things that were done before they were called to be <hi>Apoſtles;</hi> of theſe things I ſay, it muſt be granted) that 'tis moſt probable they were not Matters of their own Knowledge, that they recorded them only upon credible Information from others; But when 'tis con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider'd on the other hand, that there are very few things related by St. <hi>Luke</hi> which are not to be found in ſome of the other Goſpels, <hi>his Teſtimony</hi> that he had perfect Information of the things he has recorded from <hi>ſeveral</hi> Eye-witneſſes, adds a Degree of credibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity even to the other Goſpels, and is a good corro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borating Evidence of their Truth; And all the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters recorded by him, or the other <hi>Evangeliſts</hi> only upon <hi>Information</hi> of others, muſt be granted to be more credible than the Matter of moſt other ancient Hiſtories of good Credit is, if we reflect upon what was ſaid in the former Diſcourſe concerning the <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> and <hi>Circumſtances</hi> of the things recorded; parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly, that they were ſuch things as might be moſt <hi>certainly known,</hi> and were capable of the <hi>beſt atteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi> and that they were things done in the <hi>ſame Age,</hi> and in the <hi>ſame Countrey</hi> in which they lived who have written the Hiſtory thereof.</p>
                  <p>And what hath been ſaid is, I hope, <hi>ſufficient</hi> to ſhew the good <hi>Capacity</hi> the <hi>Authors</hi> of the <hi>Hiſtorical</hi>
                     <pb n="38" facs="tcp:52663:69"/> Parts of the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> were in to <hi>know</hi> the Truth of the Things they have recorded; moſt of them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch as 'tis probable <hi>three</hi> of the <hi>Evangeliſts</hi> (as <hi>Two</hi> of them, without all Diſpute) were <hi>Eye witneſſes</hi> of, and the reſt ſuch as they might have certain <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation</hi> of from ſeveral Perſons then alive, and well able to witneſs the ſame.</p>
                  <p>Of the <hi>Ability</hi> then of theſe Authors to write a true Hiſtory of theſe Matters, I think, there can be no reaſonable Doubt; And that there is as little Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to doubt of their <hi>Honeſty</hi> and <hi>Faithfulneſs,</hi> will in part appear; if we conſider in the third place,</p>
                  <p n="3">(3) The ſtrong <hi>Obligations</hi> they were under to <hi>write</hi> nothing but the <hi>Truth,</hi> according to the beſt of their Knowledge or Information.</p>
                  <p>Now the <hi>Obligations</hi> that Men are under to ſpeak or write Truth may be reduc'd to two Heads, <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour</hi> and <hi>Conſcience;</hi> By both which the <hi>Evangelical Writers</hi> were more ſtrongly obliged to Truth in their Relations than commonly other Hiſtorians are.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. One <hi>Obligation</hi> that lies on all Men to ſpeak or write nothing but what is true, is <hi>Honour.</hi> For there is nothing that is generally accounted more baſe or diſhonourable than to tell a Lye; there is nothing that by thoſe who ſtand moſt upon their Honour is thought more reflecting and diſparaging, and more neceſſary to be reſented as an high Affront than to have the Lye given them. What therefore is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally thought to be a great Reproach it may reaſonably be preſumed (unleſs the contrary appears) a Man will be careful to avoid by not giving any juſt Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to have it caſt upon him.</p>
                  <pb n="39" facs="tcp:52663:69"/>
                  <p>And this is one Ground of that great Credit that is generally given to ancient Hiſtories; 'tis preſum'd (unleſs there be evident cauſe to think otherwiſe) that the Authors of them were Men of ſo much <hi>Honour,</hi> and that they had ſuch a ſenſe of the Reproach and Diſcredit that it would be to them to be found out in a Lye, as made them careful not to record any thing as a certain Truth, but what they had good Knowledge or Information of.</p>
                  <p>But that this <hi>Obligation</hi> to Truth was ſtronger on the <hi>Authors</hi> of the <hi>Evangelical Hiſtory,</hi> than on moſt other Hiſtorians is abundantly evident from what was noted the laſt time concerning the Nature and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of the things by them related, and of their Hiſtory of them.</p>
                  <p>For the Matter of moſt other ancient Hiſtories is ſuch that the Hiſtorians might report many things untruly or upon ſlight Information, and yet be pretty well aſſur'd that they ſhould not be reputed Liars; becauſe the Matters recorded by them being things either done in ſome <hi>Places</hi> a good way of, or in ſome <hi>time</hi> long before, or in the Preſence of but <hi>few</hi> Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, they might know that none of thoſe into whoſe Hands their Hiſtories would fall would be in a Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city to contradict them tho' they were falſe; Or they might reaſonably ſuppoſe that their Readers would rather acquieſce in their Report, than travel ſo far or take ſo much Pains as they muſt have done to diſprove it; eſpecially if it was a Matter of no great Conſequence to their Readers whether their Report was true or falſe.</p>
                  <p>But in the <hi>Goſpel Hiſtory</hi> the Caſe was quite other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, and the Hiſtorians themſelves could not but
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:52663:70"/> know that it was ſo. For there were a great many concern'd to find out ſome Falſity in it, and there were a great many that would have taken any pains to have done it; and yet the Matters related by the <hi>Evangeliſts,</hi> and their Manner of relating them were ſuch, that their Hiſtory, if it had been falſe in any particular, might have been diſprov'd with the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt eaſe, without being at any Pains to do it; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe moſt of thoſe into whoſe Hands it firſt came, would either have known it to be falſe, or would readily have been told that it was ſo, by abundance of Perſons that could of their own Knowledge have contradicted it. So that if it be ſuppoſed that the <hi>Evangeliſts</hi> had any Regard at all to their own <hi>Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,</hi> it can't be imagin'd either that they did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord any thing contrary to their Knowledge, or that in Matters that were not of their own Knowledge they neglected to get the beſt Information and Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence that could be had; becauſe if they had done either of theſe, they could not have been ſo vain as to hope to eſcape being Cenſured as the moſt notorious and ſhameleſs Liars that ever wrote. But,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The ſtrongeſt <hi>Obligation</hi> that lies on all Men to ſpeak or write nothing but the Truth, is <hi>Conſcience;</hi> And the ſenſe that all Men are ſuppoſed to have of the natural Turpitude of a Lye, is the chief ground of that very great Credit that we give to humane Teſtimony in Caſes of the greateſt Concern and Conſequence.</p>
                  <p>But this <hi>Obligation</hi> to Truth was likewiſe ſtronger on the Authors of the <hi>Evangelical Hiſtory</hi> than on moſt other Hiſtorians; 'twas indeed ſo very ſtrong, that nothing leſs than an evident Proof of their Falſity can juſtifie the entertaining ſo much as a ſuſpicion of it.
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:52663:70"/> For to ſpeak and write the Truth was what they were obliged to, not only by the Law of Nature to which all Men are alike ſubject, but alſo by the Rules of that Religion which they had been bred up in, (by which they had been expreſly forbidden to <hi>lye one to another,</hi> and by which they had been taught that <hi>a Falſe Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that ſpeaketh Lyes is an Abomination to the Lord.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Lev. 19.11. Pro. 6.16, 19.</note>) and eſpecially by the ſtrict Command of him whom they had lately taken for their Maſter, and whoſe Laws and Religion they were to preach and propagate in the World, by which they were obliged, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſevereſt Penalty, no leſs than Eternal Damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>to put away all Lying,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Eph. 4.25. Rev. 21.8.</note> 
                     <hi>and to ſpeak every Man the Truth to his Neighbour.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Subject Matter</hi> of their Relation did alſo lay upon them the ſtrongeſt Obligation to have a ſtrict Regard to Truth in every thing that they wrote. For if it be a Sin to ſpeak an Untruth in any <hi>common</hi> Matter, it is manifeſtly a greater Sin to do it in <hi>grave</hi> and <hi>ſerious</hi> Things, when Truth is moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected; and eſpecially in <hi>Matters</hi> of <hi>Religion,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a Lye is moſt unbecoming; And if it be a Sin to utter a Slander, or to tell a Lye of a <hi>Man,</hi> it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently a Sin of a more heinous Nature, to report an Untruth concerning <hi>God,</hi> and to utter a Falſhood in the <hi>Name</hi> of <hi>God;</hi> And if to lead Men into <hi>any Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake</hi> by a falſe Relation be a Practice not to be juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, altho' the Miſtake they are led into be of no hurtful Conſequence either to themſelves or to the World, it is evidently a great Aggravation of the Lye if Men are thereby deceived in a Caſe of the <hi>neareſt</hi> and <hi>deareſt</hi> Concern to them, if they are led thereby into an Error that may prove <hi>fatal</hi> to them
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:52663:71"/> to all Eternity; And laſtly, If it be a very great Sin, only <hi>once</hi> to ſpeak an Untruth that may be prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial to <hi>one</hi> Man, it is plainly the greateſt and the moſt unpardonable Sin of this kind to <hi>record</hi> an Untruth, with a Deſign thereby to deceive to their Everlaſting Deſtruction <hi>all</hi> the <hi>Men</hi> that ſhall ever be born into the World in all future Ages.</p>
                  <p>If therefore the <hi>Goſpel Hiſtory</hi> be falſe, there was manifeſtly ſuch a <hi>Complication</hi> of moſt horrid <hi>Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs</hi> in the Publiſhers and Compilers of it, as it is not fair to ſuppoſe even <hi>one</hi> ſingle Man would be guilty of; and much leſs can it be reaſonably ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed that <hi>ſeveral</hi> Men (<hi>viz.</hi> not only the <hi>Four Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts,</hi> but <hi>all</hi> the other <hi>Apoſtles</hi> who preached the ſame things that they wrote) did conſent to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting of ſo <hi>many,</hi> and ſuch <hi>notorious</hi> and <hi>hurtful</hi> Untruths.</p>
                  <p>But this, it may be it will be ſaid, is not a direct proof that the <hi>Evangeliſts</hi> were true and faithful in their Relations, but only a <hi>probable ground</hi> of preſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming that they were ſo. And I grant it is no more, But nevertheleſs, I think, if nothing more could be offered, this alone wou'd be ſufficient to render their Teſtimony highly credible, ſo long as nothing is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged on the other ſide to diſprove it; And in all other Caſes we allow it to be ſo. For by the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of Perſons of whoſe Truth we have no other Aſſurance but ſuch a <hi>probable Preſumption,</hi> all (Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions and Controverſies of the greateſt Concern, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to the Lives and Eſtates of Men, are in this World finally decided; every Man that bears Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in any ſuch Caſe being, by the common Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Mankind, taken and accepted as a good Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:52663:71"/> unleſs the contrary appears; And by the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of two or three ſuch Witneſſes we all conſent that <hi>every Matter</hi> ſhould be <hi>eſtabliſhed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But then I add further, that beſides this <hi>reaſonable Preſumption</hi> of the Truth of the <hi>Witneſſes</hi> of the <hi>Goſpel Hiſtory,</hi> (which is all that we ordinarily have, or do deſire in other Caſes) there is as good <hi>poſitive</hi> Proof of their Truth as can be required. And this was the next Thing propos'd to be conſider'd, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">(4) The good <hi>Evidences</hi> that we have of their Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty and Faithfulneſs.</p>
                  <p>And here it may be noted (for tho' it be a thing that we lay no great ſtreſs upon in this Caſe, yet I think 'tis not to be omitted, becauſe 'tis one of the beſt Evidences that we can have of the Faithfulneſs of any Hiſtorian whoſe perſonal Character is unknown to us) that the Authors of the <hi>Evangelical Hiſtory</hi> ſeem to have related all Matters with the greateſt <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partiality;</hi> that they ſeem as <hi>free</hi> in telling the things that were, or might be accounted <hi>diſgraceful</hi> to their Maſter or themſelves, as in telling thoſe things that were moſt <hi>glorious</hi> and <hi>reputable.</hi> For thus, in their Hiſtory of the Life of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as they tell us the wonderfulneſs of his Birth, the many Miracles that he wrought, the Teſtimony that was given him by the Deſcent of the Holy Ghoſt upon him, and by the Voice of God, his Glorious Reſurrection from the Dead and Aſcenſion into Heaven; ſo they ſtick not to tell us alſo the <hi>Meanneſs</hi> of his Parentage, the <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurity</hi> of his Birth, his <hi>poor</hi> and <hi>low</hi> Condition in the World, the <hi>Affronts</hi> that were given him, the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt</hi> he was had in, and the ſhameful <hi>Death</hi> he was put to. And of themſelves, They have left it upon
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:52663:72"/> Record to all Poſterity, that they were of the <hi>mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt</hi> Extraction, and bred up to very <hi>poor</hi> or <hi>ſcandalous</hi> Employments, that they were <hi>Fiſher-Men, Tent-Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers, Publicans;</hi> They own that they were <hi>ignorant</hi> and <hi>unlearned</hi> Men; they tell their own <hi>Childiſh Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtakes</hi> about the Nature of the Kingdom of the <hi>Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah;</hi> they mention their own <hi>fooliſh</hi> and <hi>ambitious Contentions</hi> with one another about worldly Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; they confeſs their own <hi>Baſeneſs</hi> and <hi>Cowardice</hi> in forſaking their Maſter when in Danger, after the moſt ſolemn Profeſſion of Friendſhip, and repeated Aſſurances of Stedfaſtneſs and Fidelity. St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Denial of Chriſt is a thing noted by all the <hi>Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts,</hi> and by St. <hi>Peter himſelf</hi> (if the Goſpel of St. <hi>Mark</hi> be accounted <hi>his</hi>) is told with its <hi>worſt</hi> Circumſtances; and St. <hi>Paul</hi> freely owns that before his Converſion to Chriſtianity he was a <hi>Blaſphemer;</hi> a <hi>Perſecutor,</hi> and <hi>injurious,</hi> and the <hi>chief of Sinners.</hi> Now their Recording ſuch things as theſe concerning their Maſter and themſelves, as it is an Evidence of their <hi>Impartiality,</hi> is conſequently a good Argument of the Truth of their Hiſtory; for had they allowed themſelves a Liberty of varying from the Truth in any particular, it cannot be imagin'd but that they would at leaſt have concealed their own Frailties and Infirmities; it can't be ſuppos'd they would have furniſhed their Adverſaries with Matter wherewith to reproach them.</p>
                  <p>But 'tis poſſible that an Hiſtorian who means to deceive his Readers in ſome Matter of greater Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, may purpoſely inſert ſome few ſuch Paſſages as theſe, thereby to gain himſelf an eaſier Belief in other Things, and to cover his wicked Deſign. 'Tis
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:52663:72"/> therefore another and a better Evidence of the Truth of the <hi>Goſpel Hiſtory,</hi> that the <hi>Evangeliſts</hi> and other Witneſſes of the Facts recorded in the Goſpels, were Perſons not liable to any juſt ſuſpicion of Unfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs in their Relations; becauſe whatever they had been before, they were then in all other Reſpects Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of a very <hi>good Character.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Theſ. 2.10.</note> 
                     <hi>Ye are Witneſſes</hi> (ſays the Apoſtle) <hi>and God alſo, how holily and juſtly and unblameably we behaved our ſelves among you.</hi> They that could not be charged with any <hi>other Crimes</hi> were not juſtly to be ſuſpected guilty of <hi>Forgery</hi> and <hi>Lying.</hi> And we have abundant Reaſon to believe that they were in all other Reſpects unblameable, becauſe there is no Evidence that they were ever charged at all, (either truly or falſly) even by their greateſt Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, with any other Fault but only too great Zeal and Induſtry in propagating their Religion. And 'tis no Wonder that this ſhould be thought a Fault by thoſe who were of another Religion; or that by the Powers that then were, who endeavoured with all their might to ſuppreſs the Growth of Chriſtianity, the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> who were ſo zealous to ſpread it ſhould be looked upon as <hi>diſaffected</hi> to their <hi>Government,</hi> and <hi>Movers</hi> of <hi>Sedition;</hi> But however, this, if it had been a Fault, was not ſuch a Crime as could juſtly have render'd their Honeſty ſuſpected, but on the contrary, it was rather a very good Argument that however they might poſſibly be miſtaken, yet they did believe themſelves; 'tis a fair Proof that they thought they had good Evidence of the things they teſtified, and that they reckoned themſelves under a ſtrict Obligation to teſtifie the ſame.</p>
                  <pb n="46" facs="tcp:52663:73"/>
                  <p>For 'tis plain (and that's another good Argument of their Veracity) that they could have no <hi>Worldly End</hi> or <hi>Deſign</hi> either in the Framing or Publiſhing of thoſe Stories which they related; ſo that if they were <hi>Fables</hi> which they told, they were far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>cunningly deviſed Fables,</hi> becauſe, as the World then was, they could not be ſo vain as to hope to raiſe themſelves either to <hi>Honour</hi> or <hi>Wealth</hi> by preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a <hi>Crucified Meſſiah, to the Jews a Stumbling Block, and to the Greeks, Fooliſhneſs.</hi> Now 'tis not to be ſuppoſed that any Man will frame or report a Lye for <hi>nothing;</hi> Whoever knowingly deceives another, muſt be ſuppoſed to intend ſome Advantage to himſelf thereby; And therefore if there be no Untruth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing in the Relation, and no Gain or other Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage that the Reporter can be ſuppoſed to make to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf by it, it may very reaſonably be preſumed that the Report is true. But ſo far was this, if it was a Lye, from being a profitable and advantageous Lye to the Forgers and Reporters of it, that on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary it was, and they could not but readily foreſee that it would be very <hi>prejudicial</hi> to their Worldly In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts, expoſing them to all ſorts of Perſecutions from all ſorts of Men; For both <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and every Sect and Party of every other Religion, however hating one another with a mortal Hatred, readily joyned together to perſecute the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> and thoſe above all others who were the <hi>Witneſſes</hi> of Chriſtianity, the <hi>Ringleaders</hi> (as they called them) <hi>of the Sect of the Nazareens.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This therefore may be reckon'd another Evidence of their Truth; (and as 'tis a ſtronger Evidence of Truth than any that has been yet mentioned, ſo 'tis
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:52663:73"/> ſuch an one as I believe no Hiſtory in the World has, but that of the Goſpel) <hi>viz.</hi> That no <hi>Threats</hi> or <hi>Puniſhments</hi> could move the Witneſſes of thoſe things that are recorded in the <hi>Evangelical Hiſtory</hi> ſo much as to <hi>deſiſt</hi> from giving freſh Teſtimony to the Truth of the Things which they had once related. For this ſeems to have been all that was ever required or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected from them; not that they ſhould retract the Teſtimony they had given, but only that they ſhould <hi>not ſpeak or teach any more in the Name of Jeſus;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Acts 4.18.5.46.</note> And upon this Condition alone any of them might have expected both a Pardon for what they had done be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and likewiſe all fitting Favour and Encouragement. But this was what they all refuſed to do, giving no other Reaſon of their Refuſal but this, that they were very ſure of the Truth of the things they had ſpoken, and that there was a neceſſity laid upon them to preach the Goſpel. <hi>Whether,</hi> ſay they,<note place="margin">Acts 4.19, 20.</note> 
                     <hi>it be right in the ſight of God, to hearken unto you more than unto God, judge ye; for we cannot but ſpeak the things which we have ſeen and heard.</hi> And the more they were threatned to hold their Peace, ſo much the more boldly did they ſpeak, not only <hi>filling Jeruſalem with their Doctrine,</hi> but likewiſe ſpreading the ſame in all the World. And tho' they knew that <hi>in every City</hi> where they came <hi>Bonds and Afflictions did abide there; None of theſe things moved them,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Acts 20.23, 24.</note> 
                     <hi>neither did they count their Lives dear unto themſelves, ſo that they might finiſh their Courſe with Joy, and the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery which they had receiv'd of the Lord Jeſus, to teſtifie the Goſpel of the Grace of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And if theſe Proofs and Evidences already men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned of The Truth and faithfulneſs of the <hi>Apoſtles</hi>
                     <pb n="48" facs="tcp:52663:74"/> and <hi>Evangeliſts</hi> are not thought ſufficient to gain them Credit, what is there that would be ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient? for more Evidence, or better Proof cannot reaſonably be deſired, ſo good is very rarely to be met with, or expected; And indeed I think there is but only one ſtronger Proof thereof that can ever poſſibly be given by <hi>Men;</hi> And that is when a Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs lays down his <hi>Life</hi> to confirm the Teſtimony he has given; for if when a Man has witneſſed any thing, and is queſtioned for it, and threatned with <hi>Death</hi> if he perſiſts in it, he ſtill continues boldly to teſtifie the ſame thing; and eſpecially if when upon the <hi>Rack</hi> or on the <hi>Croſs,</hi> in the midſt of the <hi>ſharpeſt Torments,</hi> and even at the Hour of his <hi>Death,</hi> he Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifies the Truth of his former Teſtimony, he cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly gives the <hi>beſt Aſſurance</hi> that 'tis poſſible for any Man to give of his Honeſty and Truth; And if any humane Teſtimony be credible, this is certainly ſo in the higheſt Degree.</p>
                  <p>That therefore our Belief of the Goſpel might be built upon the ſureſt grounds, it pleaſed the Divine Wiſdom ſo to Order it that all thoſe who were the firſt Witneſſes thereof to the World, ſhould give likewiſe this beſt poſſible Proof of their Veracity. For of all the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> and <hi>Evangeliſts</hi> of the manner of whoſe Death there is any Memory preſerved ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by Hiſtory or Tradition, St. <hi>John</hi> is the only Perſon that did not ſeal the Teſtimony he had given with his Blood. And that he did not ſuffer <hi>Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> as well as the Reſt was not occaſioned by his <hi>forbearing</hi> to repeat the Teſtimony he had before gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and much leſs by his <hi>Retracting</hi> it, but was meerly an Act of Divine and <hi>Miraculous Providence,</hi>
                     <pb n="49" facs="tcp:52663:74"/> whereby tho' he was put into a <hi>Cauldron</hi> of <hi>Boyling Oyl,</hi> his Life was preſerv'd; ſo that in Truth, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the Hazard he ran of his Life, which could not have been ſaved but by a Miracle, he may very well be accounted a <hi>Martyr</hi> for the <hi>Teſtimony</hi> of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> no leſs than the other <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> altho' he did not actually <hi>expire</hi> under his Sufferings as they did.</p>
                  <p>Now if it be ſuppoſed that a Man, eſpecially one who ſtands much upon his Credit, may be willing, after he has told a Lye, to ſuffer a great Deal rather than own himſelf a Lyar; (tho' I think it cannot reaſonably be ſuppoſed, either, that any Man would ſuffer ſo many other great Evils as the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> did, only upon a Point of <hi>Honour;</hi> or that the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> did ſtand ſo much upon their <hi>Honour</hi>) yet when it is brought to this, that a Man who has told a Lye muſt either <hi>retract</hi> it, or <hi>die</hi> for it, and that he may in all Probability ſave his Life by retracting it, it is not to be ſuppoſed that any Man will be a <hi>Martyr</hi> for a <hi>known Falſhood;</hi> for it is a very true Saying, and to which there is hardly any Exception, tho' it was ſpoken by the Father of Lyes,<note place="margin">Job 2.4.</note> that <hi>Skin for Skin, yea all that a Man hath he will give for his Life?</hi> 'Tis not credible therefore that ſo much as <hi>one</hi> Man ſhould be found ſo fooliſh as to ſacrifice his Life to a known Lye, and that too an <hi>unprofitable</hi> Lye, to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, to his Family, and to all The World; and this only to ſave his <hi>Reputation;</hi> It is much leſs credible that ſo <hi>many</hi> Men, <hi>viz. all</hi> the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> and <hi>Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts,</hi> and moſt if not all the reſt of our Lord's im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Diſciples ſhould be guilty of ſuch prodigious and unheard of Folly; and it is leaſt of all credible that among ſo many as there were that bore Witneſs
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:52663:75"/> of the Facts recorded in the <hi>Evangelical Hiſtory,</hi> not ſo much as <hi>one</hi> Man ſhould be found that was <hi>honeſter</hi> and <hi>wiſer</hi> than the reſt; not <hi>one</hi> that could be perſuaded to give Glory to God by the Confeſſion of his Fault, and ſatisfaction to the World by a publick owning of the Cheat he had been engaged in; not <hi>one</hi> that wou'd chuſe to undergo the Diſgrace of a Lyar rather than the ſhameful Death of a Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor.</p>
                  <p>Theſe are in ſhort the <hi>Evidences</hi> we have of the <hi>Honeſty</hi> and <hi>Faithfulneſs</hi> of the <hi>Evangelical Hiſtorians,</hi> thoſe Evidences I mean which they themſelves have given thereof; and they are plainly as good as could be deſired, they are the beſt that could be given by Men.</p>
                  <p>And putting together all that hath been ſaid on this and the foregoing Heads, now, and in my laſt Diſcourſe, for the Proof of the Truth of the <hi>Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical Hiſtory,</hi> I think we may truly and confidently affirm, that altho' we conſider it only as a meer <hi>hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane</hi> Hiſtory, we have much greater Reaſon to give Credit to it than to any Hiſtory in the World beſides.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>if we receive the witneſs of Men,</hi> (and who is there that does not?<note place="margin">1 Joh. 5.9.</note>) <hi>the Witneſs of God is greater;</hi> And therefore in Order to ſhew further that there is <hi>ſufficient Reaſon</hi> to give full <hi>Credit</hi> to the <hi>Evangelical Hiſtorians</hi> in their <hi>Relations</hi> of thoſe <hi>Matters</hi> of <hi>Fact</hi> which they have recorded, I propoſed to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, in the Fifth and laſt Place,</p>
                  <p n="5">(5) The <hi>Confirmation</hi> that was given to the Truth of their Hiſtory, by <hi>God himſelf.</hi> For what St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſays of his own, was likewiſe true of the <hi>Speech and Preaching</hi> of all the other <hi>Apoſtles; viz.</hi> That it <hi>was
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:52663:75"/> in Demonſtration of the Spirit and of Power;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Cor. 2.4, 5.</note> 
                     <hi>that</hi> the <hi>Faith</hi> of their Hearers <hi>ſhould not ſtand in the Wiſdom of Men, but in the Power of God.</hi> And ſo St. <hi>Luke</hi> ſays; <hi>Acts</hi> 4.33. <hi>With great Power gave the Apoſtles Witneſs of the Reſurrection of the Lord Jeſus.</hi> For at the ſame Time that they <hi>Witneſſed</hi> the <hi>Miracles</hi> of their Maſter, they gave Aſſurance to Men of the Truth of their Teſtimony by doing the like <hi>Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles</hi> themſelves, healing the Sick, caſting out Devils, raiſing the Dead, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> juſt as <hi>Jeſus</hi> himſelf had done. And at the ſame time that, purſuant to their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, they preached the Goſpel to Men of all <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> and <hi>Languages,</hi> they plainly demonſtrated, both that they had ſuch a Commiſſion from God, and that it was the Truth of God which they preached, by ſpeaking to every Man of every Nation in his <hi>own Tongue.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus, as the <hi>Author</hi> to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> ſays,<note place="margin">Heb. 2.4.</note> 
                     <hi>God did bear them Witneſs both with Signs and Wonders, and with divers Miracles and Gifts of the Holy Ghoſt, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his own Will.</hi> And he might well ſay, that <hi>God</hi> did hereby bear them Witneſs, becauſe that <hi>Power</hi> wherewith they were <hi>endued</hi> was ſo evidently <hi>from on high,</hi> that none that ſaw their Works,<note place="margin">Luke 24.49.</note> and conſidered withall the Purity and Excellence of the Doctrine of Chriſtianity that was thereby eſtabliſh'd, could have any reaſonable. Doubt whether they were done by the Power of God or no. <hi>We know,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Joh. 3.2.</note> ſaid <hi>Nicodemus</hi> to our Saviour, <hi>that thou art a Teacher ſent from God, for no Man can do the Miracles that thou doeſt, except God be with him:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Joh. 14.12.</note> But the <hi>ſame Works that Jeſus did, did his Diſciples alſo,</hi> after he had ſent down the <hi>Promiſe of his Father</hi> upon them,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:52663:76"/> on the Day of <hi>Pentecoſt;</hi> yea <hi>and greater Works than thoſe did they do;</hi> ſo that whoever beheld their Works, might (ſo far as Miracles are Evidences of a Divine Power) be rather more certain that <hi>God was with them,</hi> than <hi>Nicodemus</hi> could be, that he was with our <hi>Lord himſelf.</hi> For tho' their other Miracles, that were of the ſame ſort with thoſe which our Saviour had done, were ſuch Proofs of Divine Aſſiſtance as could not, with any Reaſon be gainſaid; yet, I think it may truly be affirm'd, that the <hi>Gift</hi> of <hi>Tongues,</hi> which was peculiar to them, and wherein they did (as we may ſay) excell even our Lord himſelf, was more convincing than any of them; For he that ſaw one of their other Miracles might poſſibly entertain ſome little Doubt whether the Effect that appeared to him to be Miraculous might not yet be done by ſome ſecret Power of Natural Cauſes that was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to him; But we all know the Power of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſo well, that we are ſure, the Knowledge of a Language cannot poſſibly be attained Naturally, even by a Perſon of the quickeſt Parts and faithfulleſt. Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, but in ſo much time, at the leaſt, as it will neceſſarily take up to be told by Tutors, or to learn from <hi>Lexicons,</hi> what every particular word of the Language to be learnt, is by the People of that Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage deſigned to ſignifie; becauſe Words have not a Natural Relation to the Notions or Things thereby expreſſed, but are meer arbitrary Signs thereof. So that whoever knew the Education of the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> and that they were before altogether <hi>ignorant</hi> and <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned,</hi> and yet ſaw them every one, on a ſudden, on the Day of <hi>Pentecoſt,</hi> able to ſpeak readily in all the Languages of all the Nations under Heaven, from
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:52663:76"/> whence had come ſome of the <hi>Jews</hi> that were preſent at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> at that time, could have no poſſible Doubt of their Supernatural Aſſiſtance; They that heard them ſpeak with <hi>Tongues,</hi> which they had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver learned, could not but conclude that it was the <hi>Spirit</hi> that <hi>gave them</hi> this <hi>Utterance,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Acts 2.4.</note> becauſe nothing elſe could give it; So that this was not only (as their other Miracles were) a <hi>Proof</hi> of <hi>Inſpiration,</hi> but likewiſe an <hi>Inſtance</hi> and <hi>Example</hi> of it: It was a Proof of an inward and inviſible Inſpiration, by an Inſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that was (as I may ſay) outward and viſible; by an Inſpiration that was diſcernible even by the Bodily Senſes of all thoſe that were preſent.</p>
                  <p>But be it ſo, perhaps the <hi>Infidels</hi> will ſay, that they that ſaw the <hi>Miracles</hi> which the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> are reported to have done in the Name of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> had Reaſon enough to believe their Teſtimony concerning him, and as well <hi>that</hi> which they have left in Writing, as that which they gave by word of Mouth; Yet what's this to us that live now? For we neither ſaw the <hi>Miracles</hi> that they wrought, nor heard them ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with <hi>Tongues;</hi> neither have we any Aſſurance that they ever did either the one or the other but only from <hi>themſelves.</hi> They indeed tell us that they did a great many wonderful things (ſuch as we are willing enough to grant could not be done but by the Power of God) in Confirmation of their Teſtimony concerning <hi>Jeſus;</hi> But we ſee no more Reaſon to believe <hi>this</hi> their <hi>Teſtimony</hi> concerning <hi>themſelves,</hi> than there is to believe their other Teſtimony concerning him; ſo that <hi>this</hi> cannot in reaſon be reckoned a Proof or Confirmation of <hi>that;</hi> Nay, rather, we think they are leſs credible Witneſſes in their own Caſe than they
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:52663:77"/> were in his. So that to us the <hi>Hiſtory</hi> of the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> (granting it to be written by the <hi>Apoſtles</hi>) is of no more Authority than <hi>their</hi> Writing it (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered only with reſpect to their Natural and Moral Capacities and Qualifications) could give to it; Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that <hi>Seal</hi> of <hi>Miracles</hi> which is ſaid to have been affixed thereto by <hi>God,</hi> is now, by length of Time quite worn off; or at leaſt the Impreſſion thereof is now ſo defaced, that we cannot diſtinguiſh <hi>whoſe Seal</hi> it was, or whether it was a <hi>true Seal</hi> or a <hi>counterfeit</hi> one; And that this <hi>Seal</hi> was ever affixed to their Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony, is teſtified only by thoſe ſame Witneſſes, whoſe the Teſtimony its ſelf was.</p>
                  <p>To this Objection therefore (which, it muſt be confeſſed, has ſome Appearance of Weight and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in it) I anſwer,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. By denying the Ground it is built upon, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Teſtimony of the <hi>Apoſtles themſelves</hi> is the <hi>only</hi> Proof we have of the <hi>Miracles</hi> which they wrought for the Confirmation of their Teſtimony concerning <hi>Jeſus.</hi> For beſides the Teſtimony of the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> in their <hi>Epiſtles,</hi> and in the <hi>Acts,</hi> Witneſſing their own <hi>Miracles,</hi> we have likewiſe the Teſtimony of all the other <hi>Chriſtian Writers,</hi> whoſe Books are preſerved, that lived in or near the Apoſtle's Times, Witneſſing the ſame Thing; And this Teſtimony, not only gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven as it were in ſecret, in order to the making Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelytes of ſuch as they found to be eaſie and credu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous; but in the moſt <hi>publick manner,</hi> in thoſe <hi>Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies</hi> for the Chriſtian Faith which they preſented to <hi>Magiſtrates,</hi> and publiſhed to the whole <hi>World;</hi> in which, for Proof that theſe <hi>Miracles</hi> had been wrought by the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> they appeal to all the Hiſtories and
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:52663:77"/> Records of the Apoſtle's Times then extant; in which, they challenge any that could do it, to contradict their Teſtimony; in which, they teſtifie that the ſame Miraculous Power did ſtill continue in the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Church, and was ſometimes exerted, often enough, and openly enough to prove its being, tho' not ſo frequently as it had been by the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, when there was more need of ſhewing it, <hi>viz.</hi> at their firſt Preaching of the Goſpel.</p>
                  <p>Now theſe things, if they had not been true, the firſt Chriſtians, in the Circumſtances they were then in, would not have dared to affirm; and if they had been falſe, they might eaſily have been diſpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and they would moſt certainly have been at leaſt boldly denied and contradicted by the profeſs'd Adverſaries of the Chriſtian Faith. But they did not deny or contradict, they did not offer to diſprove the Report that was then generally believed of the <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles</hi> that had been done by the <hi>Apoſtles.</hi> Nay ſo far were they from this, that there is good Evidence from Antiquity ſtill remaining, that ſeveral even of thoſe who took upon them to oppoſe the Chriſtian Doctrine did yet expreſly own that great and mighty Works had indeed been done by the Hands of the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> as well as of their Maſter; But then they had been done, they ſaid, (and that was all they could ſay in the Caſe) by <hi>Magick Art,</hi> by the <hi>Help</hi> of the <hi>Devil;</hi> juſt as the <hi>Jews</hi> had ſaid before of our Saviour, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.24. <hi>This Fellow doth not caſt out Devils, but by Beelzebub the Prince of the Devils.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I ſhall not ſtay now to ſhew how groundleſs as well as malicious this Suggeſtion was with reference both to our Lord's Miracles and to theirs, becauſe I ſuppoſe
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:52663:78"/> I ſhall have a better Occaſion to do it hereafter in my next Diſcourſe; 'tis enough for my preſent purpoſe, if the Matter of Fact only be granted, <hi>viz.</hi> that the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> did do many <hi>Miracles</hi> in the Name of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and to confirm their Teſtimony concerning him; And that they did ſo cannot I ſay, be reaſonably doubted, becauſe 'tis witneſſed not only by <hi>themſelves,</hi> but by all the <hi>Chriſtian Writers</hi> of thoſe or the ſucceeding times, and is not denied, nay is granted even by their <hi>Adverſaries</hi> and <hi>Oppoſers.</hi> But,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. If we had not ſo good Proof of the <hi>Miracles</hi> done by the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> if there were no Witneſſes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of but themſelves, I ſay however that their Teſtimony alone would be very credible; Nay indeed the thing teſtified by them muſt, I think, neceſſarily have been acknowledged by us, altho' there had been no Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory or Record at all of it tranſmitted to our Times. I do not mean that without the Light of Hiſtory we could have known that they did juſt thoſe very <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles</hi> which are recorded, but I ſay that without this we might have known in general that they did do <hi>Miracles,</hi> or that they were aſſiſted by a <hi>Supernatural Power;</hi> (This, I ſay, we might have been ſure of) by the <hi>permanent Effects</hi> of ſuch a <hi>Power,</hi> continuing after their Times, and teſtified by all Hiſtorians, Heathen as well as Chriſtian, of all Ages ever ſince; and which are even ſtill extant and viſible.</p>
                  <p>For that a great Part of the World is now <hi>Chriſtian</hi> we ſee and know, and that it has been ſo for many Ages paſt we are as ſure as we are that there have been any Ages paſt before our own; And looking back to ſee when and how it came to be ſo, we learn, by the concurrent Teſtimony of all Hiſtory, <hi>Jewiſh, Pagan</hi>
                     <pb n="57" facs="tcp:52663:78"/> and <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> that <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> had its Beginning in <hi>Judea,</hi> juſt at that Time in which the Sacred Hiſtory places it; And by the ſame concurrent Teſtimony of all Hiſtory we learn that in a very ſhort time, in leſs than forty Years after, it was Preached in all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, and in all other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries of the World that were then known, and of which we have any Hiſtory left; and that wherever it was Preached it made a very ſwift Progreſs, inſomuch that in a few Years the number of <hi>Chriſtians</hi> became very conſiderable and bare a great Proportion to the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of all other Religions; For it was not much above threeſcore Years after the Apoſtles had diſperſed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in order to preach the Goſpel to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> when <hi>Pliny</hi> Proconſul of <hi>Bithynia,</hi> wrote that <hi>Epiſtle</hi> to the Emperor <hi>Trajan,</hi> wherein giving an Account of the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> then under a ſevere Perſecution for their Religion by the Emperor's Order, he tells him <hi>that there was a great number of Men obnoxious to Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings upon that Account; that many of all Ages, of all Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and Degrees and of both Sexes were every Day cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in Queſtion for it; that the Contagion of that Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition</hi> (as he calls it) <hi>had ſpread its ſelf not only in great Cities, but alſo in Towns and Country Villages, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch that the Temples of the Heathen Gods, had for ſome Time before been in a manner deſolate, and their Worſhip and Sacrifices intermitted.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now this is certain that there can be no Effect without a Cauſe of ſufficient Power to produce it; And it was evidently impoſſible that Chriſtianity ſhould make ſo ſwift a Progreſs, and prevail ſo much in the World, as it did, in ſo ſhort a time, only by Natural Means. For without good Skill in the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:52663:79"/> of the ſeveral Nations wherein the Apoſtles were to preach the Goſpel, it had been in vain for them to have gone about to Convert all Nations; Or if they had attempted it, 'tis impoſſible it ſhould have been with ſucceſs; And how can it be conceived poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible that <hi>twelve grown</hi> Men, who before underſtood not a word of any but their own Mother Tongue, and that perhaps not well, who had never been bred up to <hi>Study,</hi> and who were then paſt the proper <hi>Age</hi> of learning Languages, ſhould yet be able in ſo ſhort a time to become perfect Maſters of all the <hi>Languages</hi> then in uſe in the World, ſo as to ſpeak them readily and fluently, as if every one had been their own Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Tongue? and that after this, they ſhould have time enough ſtill left to go and preach the Goſpel in all Countries? So that the ſpeedy Converſion to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity of ſuch a great number of Men in all Parts of the World by their Miniſtry, is a direct proof of that <hi>Gift of Tongues</hi> wherewith we believe they were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued; And whoever can believe that they had <hi>this Gift,</hi> which was peculiar and extraordinary, and ſuch as had never been heard of in the World before, may, I think, more eaſily believe all the other <hi>Miracles</hi> that they are reported to have done, which were not near ſo wonderful, which were ſuch as had been done by other Prophets in former Times.</p>
                  <p>But ſuppoſe this Story of the <hi>Gift</hi> of <hi>Tongues</hi> to be falſe, and that indeed the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> were Men of ſuch ready Natural <hi>Parts</hi> as to be able to learn all the <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages</hi> which they could have any uſe of in as few Days as it would have taken other Men Years to do it in; or elſe that they had in truth been bred up to the <hi>Study</hi> of <hi>Languages</hi> from their Childhood, and
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:52663:79"/> only concealed their Knowledge thereof until that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Day of <hi>Pentecoſt,</hi> that ſo then it might be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to be Miraculous; Yet what could <hi>twelve Men</hi> furniſhed with this excellent Skill, do by their own <hi>Natural Power</hi> only, towards the Converſion of the World to Chriſtianity in ſo ſhort a time?</p>
                  <p>For 'tis to be conſider'd that the Religion which they were to reach in the World was the moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary that could be to the Carnal Luſts and Paſſions of Men; that it promis'd no Worldly Greatneſs, no Increaſe of Riches, no Enjoyment of Senſual Pleaſures; but on the contrary taught all thoſe that embrac'd it, to be mortified to all theſe Things, and not to ſet their Affections on any thing here below.</p>
                  <p>'Tis to be conſider'd alſo, that it propoſed to Man's Belief ſuch Doctrines as to the carnal Minds of Men could not but appear fooliſh or incredible; As that the Eternal Son of God did for our ſakes become Man, and take on him the Form of a Servant, that in that Form he ſubmitted to be ſcornfully uſed, cruelly ſcourged, and at laſt barbarouſly Crucified as a vile Malefactor by his own Creatures; that this ſame <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi> was afterwards declared to be the Son of God with Power by the Reſurrection from the Dead, that he was taken up into Heaven, ſeated at the right Hand of the Father, had all Power in Heaven and Earth committed to him, was ordered to be Worſhipped <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>'Tis to be conſider'd likewiſe, that it was a Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

<pb n="60" facs="tcp:52663:80"/> upon that Account only muſt needs meet with the ſtrongeſt Prejudices; all the Men it was preached to being before from their Childhood bred up, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready fixed in another way.</p>
                  <p>And laſtly, 'tis to be conſider'd further, that the <hi>Facts</hi> upon which this Religion was grounded, that is, by which the Divine Miſſion of the Lord <hi>Jeſus</hi> was proved, <hi>viz.</hi> his <hi>Miraculous Works,</hi> were ſuch as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing above the known Power of Natural Cauſes were not like to be eaſily credited. That he healed the Sick, that he gave Sight to the Blind, Hearing to the Deaf, Speech to the Dumb, Feet to the Lame, and Strength to the Cripples; that he did caſt out Devils; that he rais'd the Dead, and all theſe only with a Word's ſpeaking; that he fed ſometimes great Multitudes of four or five Thouſand with only ſo much Bread and Fiſh as to Appearance was not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient for twenty Men; and that after they were all ſatisfied, there was more in Bulk left in Fragments than there had been before in whole Proviſion; That he walked on the Water as on dry Land; That he had the Winds and Seas obedient to his Command; And above all, that he Raiſed himſelf to Life after he had been three Days Dead; Theſe and ſuch like were ſtrange Stories to be told to Men in order to perſuade them to take upon them a new Religion.</p>
                  <p>What then, I ſay, could <hi>twelve Men,</hi> tho' never ſo well furniſhed naturally with Parts and Learning and all other Endowments proper to qualifie them for ſuch a Work, do towards the perſuading the World to embrace Chriſtianity? Suppoſe they had gone (not as they did, one into this Country another into that; often ſingly, ſeldom more than two in Company; but) <hi>all together</hi>
                     <pb n="61" facs="tcp:52663:80"/> in a Body into ſome one Country remote from <hi>Judea,</hi> and there with <hi>concurrent Teſtimony</hi> born Witneſs of the Things they had ſeen and heard; yet who would have believ'd their Report? The Report of Strangers coming from a far Country, and of whoſe Honeſty and Truth they could have no Aſſurance but only from themſelves vouching for one another? Who would have given Credit to a Relation of ſuch incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible Stories, told with a Deſign to introduce a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion that was unknown to their Fathers? and ſuch a ridiculous Religion too, as this, at the firſt Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal, wou'd probably appear; <hi>viz.</hi> the Worſhipping as God, a Man, who by their own Confeſſion, was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected and ſet at naught, and at laſt Crucified as a wicked Malefactor by his own Countrymen.</p>
                  <p>Or if it can be ſuppoſed that the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> by the Boldneſs of their Speech and the <hi>inticing Words of Man's Wiſdom,</hi> might after ſome time have prevailed upon ſome few to become Proſelytes to their Religion; yet the multitude of their Diſciples could not have been very great, before the <hi>Government</hi> of the Country would have taken the Alarm, and have called in Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion theſe <hi>Setters forth of new Gods,</hi> theſe <hi>Movers of Sedition among the People,</hi> as they would certainly have been accounted, and as, in fact, the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> were accounted in every place where they came. And this would quickly have put a ſtop to a growing Sect; They that liked the Religion well enough before, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was new, would quickly have left off to like it when they ſaw it would be dangerous to profeſs it; 'tis not likely their Followers would have continued to ſtick to them, when they perceiv'd the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and the whole Nation in general engaged on
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:52663:81"/> the other ſide, and reſolved by all means poſſible to extirpate the Belief they had entertained; and when they ſaw their Preachers Impriſoned and Scourged, tortur'd and put to Death, they would quickly have deſerted the Service of a <hi>Maſter,</hi> who, they would then readily think, was not of Power to <hi>ſave</hi> either <hi>himſelf</hi> from the <hi>Croſs,</hi> or his <hi>Diſciples</hi> from Suffering. And after this, had the <hi>Reſidue</hi> of the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> who might poſſibly have eſcaped Martyrdom in this Country, gone into another, there they muſt have expected the like Reception and Uſage, and not bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in a third; and ſo in a few Years their Lives would have ſpun out in doing nothing, and their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion would have periſh'd with themſelves.</p>
                  <p>And if their united Teſtimony would have had ſo little Credit, much leſs can it be ſuppoſed that the <hi>ſingle Witneſs</hi> of <hi>One Apoſtle</hi> only could ever have gain'd any Credit at all; And yet unleſs the Teſtimony of ſome ſingle Witneſſes had been believ'd, 'tis impoſſible there ſhould have been, in ſo ſhort a time, ſo great a Converſion of Men to Chriſtianity in all parts of the World, by the Preaching of ſo few Men.</p>
                  <p>So that whoever believes that Chriſtianity could make ſo ſwift and ſo great a Progreſs as 'tis certain by all Hiſtory it did, only by the <hi>Preaching</hi> of the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles</hi> without any <hi>Miraculous Gifts</hi> or <hi>Supernatural Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance,</hi> wants not Faith enough to be a Chriſtian, if he had but a Will to it; for he believes already a much greater Miracle than any that is recorded in the <hi>Evangelical Story.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And now by all that hath been ſaid, in this and the laſt Diſcourſe, I hope it appears that there is <hi>ſufficient Reaſon</hi> to give full <hi>Credit</hi> to the <hi>Authors</hi> of the <hi>Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:52663:81"/> Books</hi> of the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> in their Relations of thoſe Matters of Fact which they have recorded. This I'm ſure I may ſay, that there is not ſo good Reaſon to give Credit to any Hiſtory in the World be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, of the ſame Antiquity; And that a Hiſtory ſo well confirmed as this is cannot reaſonably be rejected, nor indeed any ways be diſcredited, but either by ſome other <hi>more credible Hiſtory</hi> contradicting it, or by ſome <hi>intrinſick Evidence</hi> of Falſhood.</p>
                  <p>But better or <hi>more credible Hiſtory</hi> contradicting it, I have already obſerv'd, there is not, nor indeed is there any Hiſtory contradicting it that is of ſufficient Antiquity to diſprove it. Nay there are many very conſiderable things of thoſe recorded in the <hi>Goſpel-Hiſtory</hi> that are occaſionally mentioned by other Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorians of thoſe or the ſucceeding Times, who had no Deſign thereby to do any Service to Chriſtianity; as namely that there was ſuch a Man as <hi>John the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt,</hi> that he was a Perſon of great Piety and Auſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and a Preacher of Righteouſneſs, and that he was put to Death by <hi>Herod:</hi> That there was alſo a Man named <hi>Jeſus,</hi> who called himſelf and was owned by many to be the <hi>Chriſt,</hi> that he did many wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful things, and was at laſt Crucified by the <hi>Jews:</hi> The Names of ſome other Perſons likewiſe ſpoken of in the <hi>Goſpel-Hiſtory</hi> are mention'd under the ſame Character in ſome other Hiſtories, as <hi>Pilate, Felix, Feſtus, Caiphas, Agrippa,</hi> &amp;c. In other Hiſtories alſo we find notice taken of the Cruelty of <hi>Herod</hi> in ſlaying the Infants at <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> and among them (as 'tis thought) his own Son; which made <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> when the Story was told him, to ſay, that it was <hi>better to be</hi> Herod<hi>'s Swine than his Son;</hi> and likewiſe
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:52663:82"/> of that remarkable Eclipſe of the Sun, when the Moon was at the full, which the <hi>Evangeliſts</hi> ſay happen'd at the time of our Saviour's Paſſion; and of that violent Earthquake that was at the ſame time, and laſtly, of the prodigious Increaſe of Chriſtianity in all Parts of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, ſoon after its firſt Publication.</p>
                  <p>And if upon this Occaſion it ſhould be ſaid that the Facts recorded in the <hi>Evangelical Hiſtory</hi> and the Events that follow'd thereupon were ſo very wonderful and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable, that if they had been true they muſt in all probability have been more taken notice of than they are in other Hiſtories; I anſwer, that ſuppoſing them to be true, it could not be reaſonably expected that more mention ſhould have been made of them by other Hiſtorians than there really is; becauſe they were plainly foreign to their purpoſe, or elſe ſuch Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries as tho' they had heard of them they did not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, having perhaps never taken any pains to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine into the Truth of them. For what was it to the Purpoſe of an Author that was writing the Life of one of the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperors, or the Hiſtory of ſome famous War, or giving an Account of the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of the Civil State, to make a large Digreſſion concerning a <hi>Religious Sect</hi> begun in <hi>Judea</hi> by a Perſon that was <hi>deſpiſed</hi> in his own Country, and carried on and continued by <hi>mean</hi> and <hi>contemptible</hi> Perſons who made no Figure in the World? Or how could it be expected that an Hiſtorian who was not himſelf a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> ſhould yet give a large Account of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles of our <hi>Saviour</hi> and his <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> and other Facts upon which our Religion is grounded; which had he believ'd (as he muſt be ſuppoſed to have done, if he had deliver'd them to Poſterity as Truths) he muſt
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:52663:82"/> have been a <hi>Chriſtian?</hi> 'Tis enough in all Reaſon, and as much as could be expected in this Caſe (ſuppoſing there Facts to be true) that they are not by any Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorians that were of another Religion, contradicted or attempted to be diſprov'd; more than this would have been too much. And ſhould we now in ſome ancient Manuſcript Hiſtory new brought <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> Light, and bearing the Name of ſome <hi>Jewiſh</hi> or <hi>Heathen</hi> Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, find a large and formal Account of any of thoſe Facts relating to the Chriſtian Religion that are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded in the Goſpel; this would give very juſt ground to ſuſpect, that the whole Hiſtory (whatever other Appearance it had of Truth) was forged and counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit, or at leaſt that thoſe Paſſages ſpeaking honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably of the Chriſtian Religion or the Author of it, were knaviſhly foiſted into the Book by ſome <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Tranſcriber.</hi> For this is indeed the beſt Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that is brought to diſcredit ſome Paſſages of this kind that are now to be found in ſome <hi>Heathen</hi> or <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Hiſtorians, and particularly in <hi>Joſephus, viz.</hi> that they ſay more than was proper or likely to be ſaid by <hi>Heathens</hi> or <hi>Jews;</hi> that if thoſe Paſſages are genuine, and the Authors had believed what they themſelves wrote, they muſt have been <hi>Chriſtians.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now this I'm ſure is not fair Dealing, that the <hi>Paucity</hi> and <hi>ſlenderneſs</hi> of thoſe <hi>corroborating Teſtimonies</hi> to the Truth of the <hi>Chriſtian Hiſtory</hi> that are to be met with in other Hiſtorians, and that the <hi>Multitude</hi> and <hi>Fulneſs</hi> of ſuch Teſtimonies, ſhould <hi>both</hi> be urged as Arguments againſt Chriſtianity. And therefore when they are both urged (as they are and have been by our Adverſaries) we may reaſonably conclude that the Truth is in the Mean; and that there are indeed
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:52663:83"/> no more, nor no fewer Teſtimonies of this kind to be met with in other Writers, and that they are not either more or leſs to the Purpoſe, than (ſuppoſing the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Hiſtory</hi> to be true) might fairly be expected.</p>
                  <p>It only remains then that we enquire whether there be in the <hi>Goſpel Hiſtory,</hi> any <hi>intrinſick Evidences</hi> of Falſhood. And 'tis pretended by the Adverſaries of our Religion, that there are many ſuch; For there are, they ſay, ſome things related in the <hi>Goſpel Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory,</hi> that are altogether <hi>incredible;</hi> and there is, they ſay, oftentimes great <hi>Difference,</hi> in the ſeveral Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the ſame Story, by the ſeveral <hi>Evangeliſts;</hi> And not only ſo, but there are, they ſay, beſides, in their ſeveral Hiſtories compared together, ſome flat <hi>Contradictions</hi> and <hi>Repugnancies.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I intended therefore at the End of this Diſcourſe, if I had had time for it, to have ſpoken largely upon this Subject; But becauſe I have not, muſt referr you to thoſe Books that have been written on purpoſe to give an Account of the difficult Texts of Scripture, and to reconcile thoſe that are ſeemingly repugnant; Or for want of ſuch Books to any good Commentary on the Bible, in which you will hardly fail to meet with Satisfaction in any Difficulty of this kind, if you read it with a Mind diſpoſed to receive ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. And I ſhall conclude this Diſcourſe with only obſerving in General,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That the pretended <hi>Impoſſibilities</hi> that are ſaid to be related in the Sacred Hiſtory, are only <hi>Difficulties;</hi> They are indeed Events above and beyond the known Power and common Courſe of Nature, but they are ſuch as are eaſily Credible when they are aſcribed, as they muſt be, to the Almighty power of God.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="67" facs="tcp:52663:83"/>2. That the <hi>Difference</hi> that may ſometimes be obſerv'd in the ſeveral Relations of the ſame Story by the ſeveral <hi>Evangeliſts,</hi> is very inconſiderable; conſiſting only in this, That one perhaps relates the Story in a different Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of things than another does; Or that One tells it briefly, another more at large; Or One with a few, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with more Circumſtances; Or that ſome Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are mentioned by each of them which the other had omitted. So that this Obſervation is ſo far from being a juſt Objection againſt the Truth of the Hiſtory, that it is rather a Proof and Confirmation of it; For 'tis an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that the <hi>Evangeliſts</hi> did not conferr together in the Writing of their Hiſtories, and that they did not Copy or Tranſcribe from one another; but that every one of them reported the Story he wrote in ſuch manner as he himſelf remembred it to have been, and with ſuch Circumſtances as he himſelf took moſt notice of.

                     <p>And he ſaid, Nay, father Abraham: but if one went unto them from the dead, they will repent.</p>
                     <p>And he ſaid unto him, If they hear not Moſes and the Prophets, neither will they be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded, though one roſe from the dead.</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>IN Order to ſhew that we have <hi>ſufficient Reaſon</hi> given us to convince us of the Truth and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the <hi>New-Teſtament,</hi> and of all the Doctrines that are taught by it, I have formerly propounded to ſhew, 1. That we have <hi>ſufficient Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> to believe that the <hi>Books</hi> of the <hi>New-Teſtament</hi> were written by thoſe <hi>Perſons</hi> who are ſaid to be the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors</hi> thereof; 2. That there is <hi>ſufficient Reaſon</hi> to give full <hi>Credit</hi> to them in their <hi>Relation</hi> of thoſe <hi>Matters</hi> of <hi>Fact</hi> which they have recorded; And, 3. That if the Matters of Fact therein recorded are true, <hi>they</hi> are <hi>ſufficient Proofs</hi> of the <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Divine Authority</hi> of all the <hi>Doctrines</hi> that are therein taught. And the two firſt of theſe Points I have, I hope, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready made good.</p>
                  <p>I proceed now to the third; <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. To ſhew, That the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of the <hi>Goſpel</hi> is well grounded upon the <hi>Hiſtory</hi> of it; That if the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Fact recorded in the New-Teſtament are true,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:52663:86"/> 
                     <hi>they</hi> are <hi>ſufficient Proofs</hi> of the <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Divine Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority</hi> of all the <hi>Doctrines</hi> that are therein taught.</p>
                  <p>And Here, by the <hi>Doctrines</hi> of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand both the <hi>Articles of Faith</hi> which it propoſes to our <hi>Belief,</hi> and the <hi>Rules</hi> which it preſcribes to our <hi>Practice.</hi> Many of the former of which are them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves <hi>Parts</hi> of the <hi>Goſpel Hiſtory,</hi> as the <hi>Incarnation, Life, Sufferings, Death, Reſurrection</hi> and <hi>Aſcenſion</hi> of our <hi>Saviour;</hi> and the reſt, of both ſorts, are taught in the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> either by our <hi>Saviour</hi> himſelf, or by his <hi>Apoſtles.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And I ſuppoſe it will be readily granted that all their Doctrines are <hi>true,</hi> and alſo of <hi>divine Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,</hi> if it ſhall appear that they were <hi>commiſſioned</hi> and <hi>ſent</hi> by <hi>God</hi> to inſtruct the World; for <hi>he whom God hath ſent ſpeaketh the words of God,</hi> Joh. iii. 34.</p>
                  <p>The ſingle Point therefore to be conſider'd at this time, is, whether there be <hi>ſufficient Evidence</hi> from the <hi>Matters</hi> of <hi>Fact</hi> recorded in the <hi>Hiſtory</hi> of the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> that our <hi>Saviour</hi> and his <hi>Apoſtles</hi> were <hi>commiſſioned</hi> and <hi>ſent</hi> by <hi>God</hi> to inſtruct the World.</p>
                  <p>And firſt, Whether there be <hi>ſufficient Evidence</hi> from <hi>thence</hi> that our <hi>Saviour</hi> himſelf was a Teacher <hi>ſent</hi> from <hi>God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now that he <hi>ſaid</hi> he was ſent from God, is a <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> of <hi>Fact,</hi> and a <hi>part</hi> of the <hi>Goſpel Hiſtory,</hi> Joh. xii. 49.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>See</hi> Joh. 5.37, 38.8.38.14.10, 24.</note> 
                     <hi>I have not ſpoken of my ſelf, but the Father which ſent me, he gave me a Commandment what I ſhould ſay, and what I ſhould ſpeak.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And that he <hi>ſaid</hi> that he was the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> which had been foretold by the Prophets, is likewiſe <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> of <hi>Fact,</hi> and a <hi>Part</hi> of the ſame <hi>Hiſtory,</hi> Joh. iv. 25, 26. <hi>The Woman of Samaria ſaith unto him, I
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:52663:86"/> know that Meſſias cometh which is called Chriſt;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mat. 16.16, 17. Mar. 9.41. Luke 24.46. Joh. 9.47.</note> 
                     <hi>when he is come, he will tell us all things; Jeſus ſaith unto him, I that ſpeak unto thee, am</hi> HE.</p>
                  <p>The Queſtion therefore is, whether from the <hi>things</hi> which are recorded of him by the <hi>Evangeliſts,</hi> there be <hi>ſufficient Ground</hi> to believe the Truth of <hi>either</hi> or <hi>both</hi> theſe Pretences; I ſay of <hi>either</hi> or <hi>both</hi> of them, becauſe <hi>either</hi> of them is a <hi>ſufficient Reaſon</hi> to receive his Doctrine as <hi>True</hi> and <hi>Divine.</hi> for which cauſe therefore I ſhall not, in ſpeaking to this Subject, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh between the <hi>Evidences</hi> which the <hi>Goſpel-Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory</hi> affords of his being a <hi>Prophet,</hi> and thoſe which it affords of his being the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> but ſhall propoſe them promiſcuouſly as they come to mind.</p>
                  <p>And here I ſhall conſider, Firſt, The <hi>Credibility</hi> of our <hi>Saviour</hi>'s own <hi>Teſtimony</hi> concerning <hi>himſelf;</hi> and Secondly, The <hi>Confirmation</hi> that was given to this Teſtimony by <hi>God;</hi> grounding all that ſhall be ſaid on both theſe Heads, upon the <hi>Goſpel-Hiſtory;</hi> the Truth of which I now take for granted, as being, I hope, already ſufficiently prov'd.</p>
                  <p>Firſt then, I ſhall conſider the <hi>Credibility</hi> of our <hi>Saviour</hi>'s own <hi>Teſtimony</hi> concerning <hi>himſelf,</hi> when he ſaid that he was <hi>ſent</hi> by <hi>God,</hi> and that he was the <hi>Chriſt</hi> the <hi>Son</hi> of <hi>God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And I know 'tis commonly ſaid that a Man is not to be believed in his own Caſe. And this very thing was objected to our <hi>Saviour</hi> by the <hi>Jews,</hi> Joh. viii. 13. <hi>Thou beareſt Record of thy ſelf, thy Record is not true.</hi> But this Saying is not without Exception.</p>
                  <p>When indeed what a Man witneſſes is for his <hi>own Benefit,</hi> his Teſtimony, if it be ſingle, may reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly be rejected; eſpecially, if any Proof be made that at other times he hath told a <hi>Lye;</hi> or done any
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:52663:87"/> other <hi>ill thing</hi> for his Advantage; But otherwiſe a Man's Teſtimony <hi>concerning himſelf</hi> may be credible; nay in ſome caſes it may be more credible than ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Man's; becauſe he may ſometimes be <hi>ſurer</hi> of what he ſays concerning himſelf than another Man could be. And therefore our <hi>Saviour,</hi> who in <hi>Joh.</hi> v. 31. allows of the Reaſonableneſs of that Saying; <hi>If I bear witneſs of my ſelf my Witneſs is not true;</hi> yet when this very thing was afterwards objected to him by the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> in the Place before-cited, makes an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer in the following words; <hi>Tho' I bear Record of my ſelf,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Joh. 8.14.</note> 
                     <hi>yet my Record is true, for I know whence I came,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>And that the Teſtimony of our <hi>Lord</hi> concerning his <hi>own divine Miſſion</hi> was ſuch as we might rationally give Credit to, tho' we had no other Evidence of it, will, I ſuppoſe, ſufficiently appear, if theſe following things be conſider'd.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That his whole <hi>Life</hi> (according to the Account that is given of it by the <hi>Evangeliſts,</hi> which we now build upon, as true) was in all Reſpects <hi>ſpotleſs</hi> and <hi>unblameable;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Pet. 2.22. 1 Pet. 1.19.</note> 
                     <hi>He did no Sin, neither was Guile found in his Mouth;</hi> He was <hi>a Lamb without blemiſh and without ſpot.</hi> And this he himſelf urges as a Reaſon why his Teſtimony ought to be credited; <hi>Joh.</hi> viii. 46. <hi>Which of you convinceth me of Sin? and if I ſay the Truth why do ye not believe me?</hi> And a very good Reaſon it was; for it could not juſtly be ſuſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, that a Perſon of whom no other ill thing could be ſaid, was yet indeed in the whole Courſe of his Life guilty of a Crime of the greateſt Magnitude, <hi>viz.</hi> of <hi>Lying</hi> in the <hi>Name</hi> of <hi>God;</hi> of ſaying, that the <hi>Lord</hi> had <hi>ſent</hi> him, when indeed the <hi>Lord</hi> had not ſent him, nor ſpoken by him.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="7" facs="tcp:52663:87"/>2. It may be alſo conſider'd, that this <hi>Teſtimony</hi> of our <hi>Lord,</hi> tho' it was concerning himſelf, yet was not <hi>for himſelf;</hi> I mean it was not for his own worldly Advantage. And this Conſideration he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf likewiſe offers to the <hi>Jews,</hi> as an Argument of the Truth of his Teſtimony, <hi>Joh.</hi> vii. 18. <hi>He that ſpeaketh of himſelf ſeeketh his own Glory; but he that ſeeketh his Glory that ſent him, the ſame is true, and no unrighteouſneſs is in him.</hi> Had the Doctrine of our <hi>Lord,</hi> which he pretended was what God had commanded him to teach, been contriv'd to advance the Worldly Honour and Greatneſs of himſelf or his Followers, this would have been a juſt Prejudice againſt it, and a reaſonable Ground of ſuſpecting that he ſpake of himſelf; but when it was evident to all that heard his Diſcourſes, (and is no leſs ſo to us that read them) that he ſought not his own Glory in any thing, but the Glory of him that ſent him, and that his whole Doctrine tended to advance the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of God, and to promote the Practice of Piety and Virtue in the World; this rendred his Teſtimony very credible, when he ſaid he was <hi>ſent</hi> by <hi>God</hi> to teach it to the World; for when a Doctrine is plainly worthy of God, and <hi>according to Godlineſs,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Tim. 6.3.</note> it may reaſonably be preſumed that <hi>God</hi> is the Author of it.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It may be further conſidered, that this Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of our <hi>Lord</hi> concerning himſelf was ſo far from being to his own Benefit, that it was as much as any thing could poſſibly be to his <hi>Worldly Diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage,</hi> expoſing him to the Envy and Malice of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and to the Jealouſie of the <hi>Romans,</hi> and to all the cruel Sufferings which he endured from both of them. And certainly a Man's Teſtimony concerning himſelf may be allow'd to be credible if it be againſt
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:52663:88"/> his own Intereſt, if he himſelf be a great Loſer or Sufferer by what he Teſtifies; for it can't be imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned what elſe but only the Evidence of Truth, and an Obligation to declare it, ſhould ever induce a Man to ſay ſuch things concerning himſelf, as will procure his own miſchief.</p>
                  <p>And I know not what can be ſaid to avoid the Force of this Argument for the Truth of our Saviour's Teſtimony that he was <hi>ſent</hi> from <hi>God,</hi> and that he was the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> unleſs it be that he was diſappointed in his Expectation; and that he hoped to make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf Rich and Great in the World by theſe Glorious Pretences, tho' in the Event it prov'd otherwiſe. But the <hi>Goſpel-Hiſtory</hi> furniſhes us with a very clear and full Anſwer to this Objection in thoſe many <hi>Predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions</hi> of our <hi>Lord</hi> therein recorded concerning his own Sufferings;<note place="margin">Mat. 16.31.20.17.</note> whereby it clearly appears, that the Sufferings which befel him for giving this Teſtimony concerning himſelf did not happen to him <hi>unexpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly,</hi> but that he knew long before all that after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards came to paſs. And therefore I ſay again, that no Reaſon can be imagin'd why he ſhould <hi>ſay</hi> that he was ſent from God, but only becauſe he knew it was true, and had receiv'd a Command from his Father to declare this Truth to the World. Eſpecially if it be conſider'd further—</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Laſtly, That he continu'd to teſtifie the ſame at his <hi>Death</hi> which he had done before in his Life, giving thereby the beſt Aſſurance that a Man can give of the Truth of his Teſtimony. For the main Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of his Accuſation to <hi>Pilate</hi> was that he had given out himſelf to be the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> and the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> was (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Expectation of the <hi>Jews</hi>) to be a great Temporal <hi>King;</hi> had our Lord therefore but denied
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:52663:88"/> this Charge, had he but granted that he was not the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> he might have ſaved his Life. But this he would not do; he diſowned indeed the <hi>falſe Notion</hi> that the <hi>Jews</hi> had of the <hi>Meſſiah; my Kingdom,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">John 18.26. Mat. 27.11. Joh. 18.37. Mat. 26.63, 64. Mar. 14.61, 62.</note> ſays he, <hi>is not of this World;</hi> But that he was a <hi>King,</hi> and that he was the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> he boldly owned, as well when the Queſtion was put to him by the <hi>Roman Governor,</hi> who had Power of Life and Death, as when it had been put to him before by the <hi>High-Prieſt.</hi> This therefore is a ſtrong Confirmation of the Truth of this Teſtimony of our <hi>Lord;</hi> and is alone ſufficient to make it credible, that he <hi>witneſſed</hi> the ſame <hi>good Confeſſion before Pontius Pilate,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Tim. 6.13.</note> which he had done be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his own Nation, and Sealed his Witneſs with his Blood. For 'tis not to be ſuppoſed that any Man tells a known Lye for nothing; and it was plainly then too late for him, to hope for any good to himſelf in this World by perſiſting in this Teſtimony; (his only Hope had been in retracting it) and 'tis not credible that any Man ſhould be ſo fooliſh as to expect to bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter himſelf in the other World, by dying with a Lye in his mouth.</p>
                  <p>Thus, I hope, it appears that the <hi>Teſtimony</hi> of our <hi>Lord</hi> concerning his <hi>own divine Miſſion,</hi> was <hi>credible</hi> in <hi>it ſelf;</hi> ſo that we might rationally believe, that he <hi>came</hi> from <hi>God,</hi> and that he was <hi>Chriſt</hi> the <hi>Son</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> altho' we had only his own Word for it.</p>
                  <p>But we have more than his own Word for it; <hi>I am not alone,</hi> ſays he, <hi>Joh.</hi> viii. 16, &amp;c. <hi>but I and the Father that ſent me. It is alſo written in your Law, that the Teſtimony of two Men is true; I am one that bear Witneſs of my ſelf, and the Father that ſent me beareth Witneſs of me.</hi> And this was the other thing I propoſed to conſider, in order to ſhew the <hi>good Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi>
                     <pb n="10" facs="tcp:52663:89"/> that we have to believe that our <hi>Saviour</hi> was <hi>ſent</hi> from <hi>God,</hi> and that he was the <hi>Meſſiah; viz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, The <hi>Confirmation</hi> that was given to this Teſtimony of our <hi>Lord,</hi> by <hi>God</hi> himſelf. And this was given ſeveral ways.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>God</hi> bare him Witneſs by the <hi>Teſtimony</hi> of <hi>ancient Prophets;</hi> And to this our Saviour frequently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peals, <hi>Joh.</hi> v. 39. <hi>Search the Scriptures, for in them ye think ye have Eternal Life, and they are they which teſtifie of me;</hi> And again, <hi>v.</hi> 46. <hi>Had ye believed Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, ye would have believed me, for he wrote of me.</hi> And this St. <hi>Peter</hi> (comparing it with that <hi>Voice</hi> from <hi>Heaven</hi> teſtifying him to be the <hi>Son</hi> of <hi>God,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 Pet. 1.18, 19.</note> of which he himſelf had been an Ear-witneſs) calls <hi>a more ſure word of Prophecy.</hi> And indeed it was as certain an Evidence of his divine Miſſion as could be deſir'd.</p>
                  <p>For it was a Matter of the greateſt Concern to the World, to diſcern the promis'd <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> that ſo they might know in whom to Believe, and from whom to expect Salvation: And to this End <hi>God</hi> was pleaſed, by the mouth of all his holy <hi>Prophets</hi> ſince the World began, to give ſeveral <hi>Marks</hi> and <hi>Characters</hi> of the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> by which he might be certainly known, and readily diſtinguiſh'd from all Impoſtors; for they foretold exactly the <hi>Time</hi> of his <hi>Coming,</hi> his <hi>Pedigree,</hi> and the <hi>Place</hi> of his <hi>Birth,</hi> the <hi>manner</hi> of his <hi>Life,</hi> the <hi>Things</hi> he was to <hi>do,</hi> the <hi>Sufferings</hi> he was to <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo,</hi> and all the remarkable <hi>Accidents</hi> that were to befall him in this World; all which Predictions were punctually fulfill'd in the Perſon of our bleſſed <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,</hi> as muſt be granted by every one that allows the truth of the <hi>Goſpel-Hiſtory.</hi> And this is an unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niable Proof that he was the <hi>Meſſiah;</hi> for it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly inconſiſtent with the <hi>Wiſdom</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> when
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:52663:89"/> he meant to give <hi>Marks</hi> and <hi>Characters</hi> by which the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> might be certainly known, to give only ſuch as might belong to <hi>another Perſon</hi> no leſs than to <hi>him;</hi> and it is no leſs inconſiſtent with his <hi>Goodneſs</hi> that his Providence ſhould ever permit that all the <hi>Marks</hi> and <hi>Characters</hi> of the true <hi>Meſſiah</hi> ſhould meet together in an <hi>Impoſtor;</hi> becauſe by this, Mankind muſt have lain under an inevitable Neceſſity of being cheated in a Matter of the greateſt Conſequence to their Eternal Salvation.</p>
                  <p>But the ancient Prophecies of <hi>Chriſt</hi> were many of them in Types or Figurative Expreſſions, not readily to be underſtood 'till they were accompliſh'd, nor then very eaſie to be applied by every one to the Perſon of the true <hi>Meſſiah</hi> without the Help of a Teacher. <hi>How can I underſtand what I read</hi> (ſaid the <hi>Eunuch,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Acts 8.31.</note> even when he was reading one of the plaineſt Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of <hi>Chriſt</hi> that is in the Old Teſtament) <hi>except ſome man ſhould guide me?</hi> And therefore God was pleaſed to give a yet more certain and diſtinct Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of him to the Men of that Generation in which he appear'd; And this he did—</p>
                  <p n="2">2. By the <hi>Teſtimony</hi> of <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt,</hi> who was <hi>a burning and a ſhining Light,</hi> and did not, as the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Prophets had done, only lay down <hi>Marks</hi> and <hi>Characters,</hi> by the wiſe Application whereof Men might diſcern the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> when they ſaw him; but <hi>pointed</hi> to him, as it were with his <hi>Finger,</hi> as he ſtood before their Eyes, ſo that the ſimpleſt among them could not but know whom he meant; <hi>Behold,</hi> ſays he, <hi>the Lamb of God,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Joh. 1.29, 30.</note> 
                     <hi>which taketh away the Sin of the World. This is he of whom I ſaid, after me co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth a Man which is preferred before me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="12" facs="tcp:52663:90"/>
                  <p>And to this <hi>Teſtimony</hi> of <hi>John</hi> our <hi>Saviour</hi> himſelf frequently appealed, as to a Teſtimony that was full to the purpoſe and could not be denied; <hi>Ye ſent unto John,</hi> ſays he, <hi>and he bare witneſs unto the Truth, Joh.</hi> v. 32.<note place="margin">Mat. 21.23. <hi>&amp;c</hi>
                     </note> And when the <hi>Chief Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Elders</hi> queſtion'd him about his Authority, he perfectly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded them by only asking them whether the <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm of John was from Heaven or of Men;</hi> for that <hi>John</hi> was a <hi>Prophet,</hi> altho' he did no Miracles, was ſo evident to all by the wonderful manner of his Birth, and the miraculous Circumſtances that attended it, that they could not; and he was alſo ſo generally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd and accepted among the People as a <hi>Prophet,</hi> that they dared not deny it: <hi>If,</hi> they ſay, <hi>we ſhall ſay of Men, all the People will ſtone us, for they be perſuaded that John was a Prophet;</hi> and yet had they granted this, which they could not deny, they had anſwer'd their own Queſtion, and ſeen clearly by what Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity our <hi>Saviour</hi> acted and taught; for no Teſtimony of his divine Miſſion could be plainer and clearer than that of <hi>John</hi> was; and it was a thing granted by the <hi>Jews,</hi> that <hi>he is a Prophet without all doubt and needs no farther Trial, unto whom another Prophet bears Witneſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. Another way by which <hi>God</hi> gave Witneſs to our <hi>Saviour,</hi> that he was <hi>ſent</hi> by him, and that he was the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> was by a <hi>Voice</hi> from <hi>Heaven;</hi> which Teſtimony was given him three times.</p>

                  <p>A Second time was at his <hi>Transfiguration</hi> on the <hi>Mount,</hi> when the Glory of <hi>God</hi> appearing in a Cloud,<note place="margin">Ex. 24.15. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Mat. 17.5.

                     <hi>two</hi> of which have witneſſed the ſame to us under their own Hands.</p>
                  <p>A Third time was after the <hi>raiſing</hi> of <hi>Lazarus,</hi> when were preſent not only his <hi>Apoſtles</hi> who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly accompanied him,<note place="margin">Joh. 12.20, 28.</note> but ſeveral others both <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Greeks.</hi> And this Voice was ſo loud as to be heard by all that were preſent, tho' not by all ſo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly and articulately, as it was by ſome, who, as 'tis probable, were nearer than the reſt; which was the occaſion of that Difference that was among the People concerning it; <hi>ſome ſaying that it Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, and others, that an Angel ſpake to him.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ver. 29.</note> To doubt therefore of his divine Miſſion whom <hi>God</hi> thus teſtified to by <hi>Voices</hi> from <hi>Heaven,</hi> is to <hi>make God</hi> himſelf <hi>a Lyar,</hi> as the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſpeaks,<note place="margin">1 Joh. 5.10.</note>

                  <p n="4">4. Another way by which <hi>God</hi> gave Witneſs to the <hi>divine Miſſion</hi> of our <hi>Saviour</hi> was by enduing him with the <hi>Gift</hi> of <hi>Prophecy,</hi> or foretelling things to come.<note place="margin">Mat. 16.21.20.17, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Mar. 9.31.10.33.</note> Several Inſtances of which we meet with in the <hi>Goſpel-Hiſtory,</hi> for he foretold very often his own Sufferings and Death, with all the remarkable Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances thereof; He ſaid that he ſhould be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray'd by one of his own Diſciples,<note place="margin">Mat. 26.21. John 6.70.</note> when none of them ſuſpected that there was a falſe Brother among

Mar. 13. Luk. 21.</note> before that Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration paſſed away, and the Diſperſion of the <hi>Jews</hi> into all Nations: And ſeveral other things, which it would take up too much time now to mention, he foretold ſhould be juſt in that manner in which they afterwards came to paſs.</p>
                  <p>Concerning which it may be noted, that ſome of his Prophecies were fulfilled <hi>ſoon after</hi> they were ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, the punctual Accompliſhment whereof, was to thoſe that both heard them ſpoken and ſaw them ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled, an evident Proof of his Prophetical Spirit, and a juſt Ground of expecting the Accompliſhment of all his other Prophecies in their Seaſon; and that others were not to be fulfilled 'till a <hi>good while after,</hi> the Accompliſhment whereof at the time foretold, and
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:52663:91"/> long after the Predictions thereof had been recorded by the <hi>Evangeliſts,</hi> was a good Evidence to thoſe that lived then, and is alſo to us that live now, and either read the Accompliſhment thereof in Hiſtory, or ſee the ſame with our own Eyes, that he was endued with a Divine Spirit; and likewiſe takes away all reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Ground of a Suſpicion which we might otherwiſe have had, that in thoſe Inſtances wherein both the Prophecy and the Accompliſhment of it are related by the ſame Authors, the Prophecies were forged after the Events were come to paſs.</p>
                  <p>Now if this be true (and it is certainly true, if the <hi>Goſpel-Hiſtory</hi> be ſo) that our <hi>Saviour</hi> did foretell ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things which afterwards happened, and thoſe very caſual and contingent things, depending upon the free will of Men, this was an evident token that he had a divine Spirit; for none can certainly foretell ſuch things but <hi>God</hi> only, or thoſe whom he enlightens with his Spirit; And therefore the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> made this Challenge to the <hi>Idols</hi> of the <hi>Heathens,</hi> Iſa. 41.23. <hi>Shew the things that ſhall be hereafter, that we may know that ye are Gods.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And if to this it ſhould be objected that future E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents have been ſometimes foretold, by ſuch as have not been true Prophets of God, nor enlightned by his Spirit, as by <hi>Diviners, Aſtrologers</hi> and <hi>South-Sayers,</hi> and by the <hi>Oracles</hi> of the <hi>Heathens;</hi> this may be granted without any weakning of the Argument I am now upon for the Proof of our Saviour's divine Miſſion.</p>
                  <p>For there may be ſome future Events upforeſeen by us, and yet depending ſo intirely upon the Courſe of Natural Cauſes, that unleſs hindred by a Miracle, they will as certainly come to paſs as the Sun will riſe to<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>morrow;
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:52663:92"/> And theſe, the <hi>Devil,</hi> who underſtands much better than we do the Power and Courſe of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, may foreſee and conſequently foretell; and When ſuch a thing is foretold, we, who underſtand very little of Nature, may think it a Prophecy, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as in truth there is no more of a Prophetical Spirit in the <hi>Devil</hi> when he foretells ſuch things, than there is in a skilful <hi>Aſtronomer,</hi> when he Calculates and fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tells to a Minute for ſeveral Ages to come, the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Eclipſes of the Sun, Moon, and Planets.</p>
                  <p>And even in future <hi>Contingencies,</hi> 'tis no wonder that the Events have ſometimes verified the Predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of the <hi>Devil</hi> and his <hi>Prophets;</hi> for this alſo may well enough be accounted for, without allowing that any Being hath a certain Foreknowledge of future Contingencies but God only, if we do but ſuppoſe, as we may very reaſonably do, that the <hi>Devil</hi> hath a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecter Knowledge than we can have, of the Counſels, Intrigues and Intereſts of Men, that he underſtands their Tempers and Inclinations, that he hath lived a great while, and made very exact obſervations, that he hath had a long Experience of things, and hath alſo a notable ſagacity much beyond what is in any Man; for ſo even a wiſe obſerving and experienc'd Man, may without a Spirit of Prophecy, ſee much further before him than Men commonly do, and may foretell, by a Gueſs that ſhall rarely fail, a great many things which a leſs thinking and experienc'd Man would never have thought of; And when the thing happens that was foretold, it may be paſt the Skill of others to judge, whether it was foretold by a Sagacious Gueſs, or by a certain Foreknowledge of what would be.</p>
                  <pb n="17" facs="tcp:52663:92"/>
                  <p>And that the Predictions of <hi>Diviners,</hi> and the <hi>Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles</hi> of the <hi>Heathens</hi> concerning future <hi>Contingencies,</hi> have been no more than only probable Conjectures (unleſs when they have been borrowed from divine Prophecies, as they may have often been) is evident by their uncertain Accompliſhment; Some things in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed have happened as they have been foretold, but others have not ſo happened; and becauſe the <hi>Devil</hi> could not always certainly tell what the Events of thoſe things would be which he was Conſulted with about, he commonly gave out his <hi>Oracles</hi> in <hi>ambiguous Expreſſions,</hi> that ſo, whatever happen'd he might be thought to have foretold it. And when the Predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of any Perſon pretending to Prophecy, have fail'd in ſome Inſtances, tho' in others they have been accompliſh'd, this is a certain Argument that he did not Propheſie by a divine Spirit; according to what is ſaid, <hi>Deut.</hi> xviii. 21, 22. <hi>If thou ſay in thine heart, How ſhall we know the word which the Lord hath not ſpoken? When a Prophet ſpeaketh in the name of the Lord, if the thing follow not nor come to paſs, that is the thing which the Lord hath not ſpoken, but the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheth hath ſpoken it preſumptuouſly.</hi> In which words it ſeems to be implied (tho' it be not expreſly ſaid) that if the thing foretold) did come to paſs, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially that if of many things which the Prophet had foretold, and which could not be fore-known by the greateſt Skill in Natural Cauſes, (ſuch as are the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of a free Agent) not one thing fail'd, but his words were made good by the Event in every particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, they might then depend upon it that he was a true Prophet; except only in one Caſe mentioned in <hi>Deut.</hi> 13.<note place="margin">Deut. 13.1, 2, 3.</note> 
                     <hi>viz.</hi> When he made uſe of that Credit which the Accompliſhment of his Predictions had
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:52663:93"/> gain'd him, to draw Men from the Worſhip of the true and only God, to the Worſhip of Idols. And accordingly 'tis obſerv'd in 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> iii. 19, 20. that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the <hi>Lord did let none of Samuel's words fall to the Ground, all Iſrael from Dan even to Beerſheba knew that he was eſtabliſhed to be a Prophet of the Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The before-named Exception having therefore no Place in our <hi>Saviour,</hi> for his Doctrine was, <hi>Thou ſhalt worſhip the Lord thy God,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mat. 4.10.</note> 
                     <hi>and him only ſhalt thou ſerve;</hi> and there being not one of thoſe many Predictions that he gave forth (tho' ſeveral of them were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the moſt caſual Events that could be) which has not been in its due time fulfilled, we may ſafely conclude that he was a true <hi>Prophet</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently, that he ought to be hearkned to in every thing that he ſaid.</p>

That 'tis a thing which we cannot be ſure of, that the true Reaſon why any of thoſe who ſaw our Saviour's Miracles, or were perſuaded of the Truth of them, did yet refuſe to receive him as a Prophet ſent from God, was becauſe they were not convinc'd that his Miracles were done by a divine Power; for Men do not always act according to their Judgments; for we read of ſome of the <hi>Chief Rulers</hi> in <hi>Joh.</hi> xii. 42. that they <hi>believed on him,</hi> that is, they were convinc'd in their Judgments, by the mighty Works that he did, that he was the Perſon he pretended to be, <hi>but they did not confeſs him, leſt they ſhould be put out of the Synagogue; for they loved the Praiſe of Men more than the Praiſe of God.</hi> And therefore I think it moſt probable, that they who attributed thoſe Miracles of his which they could not deny, to the working of the <hi>Devil,</hi> did not, nay could not believe what they ſaid, but only ſaid it, becauſe they were reſolv'd never to receive a Doctrine (whatever Evidence was given of the Truth of it) that was ſo contrary as our Saviour's was, to their Prejudices, Luſts, and World<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Intereſts; and they could not tell what elſe to ſay to juſtifie themſelves to the World. But,</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="20" facs="tcp:52663:94"/>2. If their Blaſphemy in aſcribing our Saviour's Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles to the power of the <hi>Devil,</hi> was not meerly mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, 'twas, however, moſt evidently groundleſs. For,</p>
                  <p n="1">(1.) Tho' the <hi>Devil</hi> be without doubt of much greater Power than we are, and, underſtanding bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than we do the Force of Natural Cauſes, can do many things which to the Eyes of Men may appear Miraculous, becauſe it may be paſt their Skill to give an Account of them by Natural Cauſes; there is no reaſon however to believe that he can do a true Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle; that is, that he can ever alter the Courſe of Nature, or produce any Effect but by the Means of Natural Cauſes, working in ſuch a manner, and by ſuch Laws and Rules as <hi>God</hi> hath appointed: And therefore the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> calls thoſe ſtrange Appearances which are done by the <hi>working of Satan,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 Theſ. 2.9.</note> 
                     <hi>Lying Wonders.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But they were not <hi>Lying Wonders</hi> which were done by our <hi>Saviour;</hi> they did not only ſeem to be done, but were done, and they were Miracles not only in appearance but in truth, being many of them ſuch Effects as were evidently above and beyond the Power of Nature, and therefore ſuch as could not be done but by a Power Superiour to Nature, that is, by God's.</p>
                  <p>For who, but he only who at firſt brought all things out of nothing,<note place="margin">Mat. 14. Mark 6. Luke 9. John 6.</note> could with five Loaves, and two ſmall Fiſhes, ſatisfie the Hunger of more than five thouſand Perſons, leaving a Remainder of more than twice the number of Baskets-full of Fragments, that there had been of Loaves at the firſt?<note place="margin">Luk. 7.11, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Joh. 11.39, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </note> Or who could reſtore to Life a dead Carkaſs that began to putrefie, but he only who firſt form'd it out of the Duſt of the Ground? Who could call back the departed
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:52663:94"/> Soul, and fix it to its former Reſidence, but he only into whoſe Hands it was returned, and who firſt breathed into our Bodies theſe Immortal Spirits?</p>
                  <p>And as to ſome other of his Works which may be thought to be ſuch as might be produc'd by the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Nature only, the manner in which they were done, plainly ſhews that they alſo were done by a Power Superior to Nature; for thus, a Sick Man may be reſtor'd to perfect Health, in time, and by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, by the uſe of proper Medicines, and ſuch a Cure we reckon Natural; But thoſe were plainly Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per-natural Cures which were wrought, as our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's for the moſt part were, without the uſe of any Medicines, only by a Word ſpeaking, and many times at a great diſtance; and by which thoſe who had been long Sick or Infirm, or Cripples, were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor'd to perfect Health and Strength in an inſtant of time. To ſuppoſe therefore that the <hi>Devil</hi> can thus at his Will alter the Courſe of Nature, is to attribute to him ſuch a Power as is peculiar to the <hi>God</hi> of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, who only doth great Wonders.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pſ. 72.18.136.4.</note> But</p>
                  <p n="2">(2.) If the Miracles of our <hi>Saviour</hi> had been only ſuch as we might reaſonably think did not exceed the Devil's Power to do, yet that they were not wrought by his Help, and conſequently that they were done by the Power of <hi>God,</hi> is abundantly evident from the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign</hi> of them; which was to eſtabliſh a Doctrine the moſt contrary that could be to the Devil's Intereſt. For <hi>to this Purpoſe the Son of God was manifeſted that he might deſtroy the works of the Devil;</hi> and he did it,<note place="margin">1 Joh. 3.8.</note> by <hi>preaching to Men to turn from the vanities of Idols to the worſhip and ſervice of the Living God,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Act. 14.15. Tit. 2.12.</note> 
                     <hi>who made Heaven and Earth;</hi> and by <hi>teaching them to deny Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godlineſs and Worldly Luſts, and to live Soberly, Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly and Godly in this preſent World.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="22" facs="tcp:52663:95"/>
                  <p>Now the <hi>Devil</hi> is certainly as ſubtle as he is pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful, and therefore if he has indeed any power to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the courſe of Nature and to do a real Miracle, he would not, however, we may be ſure, make uſe of this Power againſt himſelf, he would not thereby aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt another to deſtroy his own Kingdom. And by this Argument our <hi>Saviour</hi> himſelf clearly confuted this Calumny, in <hi>Mat.</hi> xii. 25. When the <hi>Phariſees</hi> had ſaid that <hi>he caſt out Devils by Beelzebub the Prince of the Devils;</hi> he anſwer'd, <hi>Every Kingdom divided a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it ſelf is brought to Deſolation—and if Satan caſt out Satan, he is divided againſt himſelf; how then ſhall his Kingdom ſtand?</hi> And</p>
                  <p n="3">(3.) Laſtly, As it is not credible that the <hi>Devil</hi> has ſuch power; or if he has, and was let alone to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, that he would make uſe of this power to deſtroy his own Kingdom; ſo neither is it credible that <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God,</hi> who has all power in his Hands, and can controul and limit the workings of the <hi>Devil</hi> and all created Beings as he pleaſes, would ever permit the <hi>Devil</hi> to out-do himſelf in ſuch wonderful Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; ſo that more and greater Miracles ſhould be done by an <hi>Impoſtor,</hi> than ever had been done before by any <hi>true Prophet;</hi> which yet is manifeſtly the Caſe, if indeed our <hi>Saviour</hi> was an <hi>Impoſtor.</hi>

                     <hi>to ſhew great Signs and Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders;</hi> and in juſt Judgment upon ſuch as will <hi>not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the love of the Truth that they may be ſaved;</hi> to let them alone to be deceived by that <hi>wicked one, whoſe Coming is after the working of Satan, with all Power, and Signs and Lying Wonders, and with all De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveableneſs of Unrighteouſneſs in them that periſh.</hi> But it cannot, I think be reconciled to theſe Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes of God, that he ſhould permit greater Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and more clear and undoubted Miracles to be done by a falſe Prophet, than ever were done by any true Prophet; becauſe this would be too great a Trial for Humane Nature; ſuch Signs and Wonders would be ſufficient to deceive even thoſe that enquire after Truth with the greateſt ſincerity of Heart. And I cannot conceive it conſiſtent with the Goodneſs of God, to permit that ſuch as are of honeſt Minds, and ſincere Lovers of Truth, ſhould, after a fair Examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Proofs on both ſides, have greater rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to embrace Error than Truth; which yet they plainly have in caſe the Miracles done by falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:52663:96"/> be more and greater than have been done by any true Prophet, unleſs the Falſeneſs of the Doctrines which they would thereby eſtabliſh be more evident than the Truth of their Miracles. So that upon the whole, I think we may well conclude this Head, with thoſe Words of <hi>Nicodemus</hi> to our <hi>Saviour,</hi> Joh. iii. 2. <hi>We know</hi> (we are aſſured of it, we have no Reaſon to doubt of it) <hi>that thou art a Teacher come from God, for no Man can do theſe Miracles that thou doeſt, except God be with him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6. Another way by which <hi>God</hi> himſelf bare Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to the Truth of our Saviour's Teſtimony, was by <hi>Raiſing</hi> him from the <hi>dead.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Joh. 2.19. Mat. 12.40.16<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 4.</note> To this great Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle he himſelf often referred thoſe that had any doubt of the Truth of his other Miracles, as what could not but be ſatisfactory to all that were capable of recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Satisfaction. And this was the chief Subject of the <hi>Apoſtle</hi>'s Sermons,<note place="margin">Acts 2.24.32.3.15.4.10.10.40.13.30.</note> the main Proof that they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted upon to convince Men that <hi>Jeſus</hi> was the <hi>Chriſt:</hi> And they ſeem to have no doubt upon them, that if they could but perſuade Men of the Truth of his Reſurrection, they would readily own that he was the <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and without further ſcruple receive every thing that he had taught them in the name of God as a divine Truth.<note place="margin">Acts 17.30.</note> 
                     <hi>By this,</hi> ſay they, <hi>God has given Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance unto all Men, that he has ordained him to be the Judge of the World: By this,</hi> ſay they, <hi>he was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared to be the Son of God with Power;</hi> becauſe it was a thing evident to all,<note place="margin">Rom. 1.4.</note> that no Power leſs than God's could raiſe the dead.</p>
                  <p>When therefore this was done, (and it was done if the <hi>Goſpel-Hiſtory</hi> be true) this was a plain Seal ſet by God himſelf to our Saviour's Teſtimony; a <hi>Seal</hi> not poſſible to be Counterfeited, and wherein the Divine
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:52663:96"/> Power is ſo clearly and deeply engraven, that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever looks attently upon it, muſt be ſatisfied whoſe Seal it is. So that to grant the Reſurrection of our Saviour, and yet to doubt whether he was the Perſon he gave out himſelf to be, is to doubt of the <hi>Truth</hi> of <hi>God</hi> himſelf; for granting our Saviour's Reſurrection, it can't be ſuppos'd that he was an Impoſtor, without ſuppoſing that <hi>God</hi> himſelf did conſent to the Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture, and work the moſt evident Miracle that ever w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>I ſhall mention at preſent but one way more where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by <hi>God</hi> was pleas'd to confirm our Saviour's Teſtimony of himſelf; And that was—</p>
                  <p n="7">7. By the <hi>Witneſs</hi> of the <hi>Holy-Ghoſt,</hi> which wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs was given to him at his <hi>Baptiſm,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Joh. 1.32, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </note> when the <hi>Holy-Ghoſt deſcended in a viſible manner as a Dove and reſted on him.</hi> It was alſo given to him during the whole Courſe of his <hi>Miniſtry;</hi> for the <hi>Holy-Ghoſt</hi> not only deſcended, but <hi>abode upon him;</hi> and therefore St. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> ſpeaking of him,<note place="margin">Act. 10.38, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                  <p>But that Witneſs of the <hi>Holy-Ghoſt</hi> which I now chiefly deſign, was <hi>that</hi> which was given to him after his Aſcenſion into Heaven, and was an evident Token that all power in Heaven and Earth was then commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to him; I mean thoſe <hi>Gifts</hi> of the <hi>Holy-Ghoſt</hi> which he ſhowred down on his <hi>Apoſtles</hi> on the <hi>Day of Pente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coſt; when being met together,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Acts 2.1, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                     <hi>there came ſuddenly a ſound from Heaven as of a ruſhing mighty Wind, which filled all the Houſe where they were ſitting, and there appeared unto them Cloven Tongues like as of Fire, which ſat upon each of them;</hi> whereupon <hi>they wre all filled with the Holy-Ghoſt, and began to ſpeak with other Tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance.</hi>

                  <p>And this <hi>Teſtimony</hi> of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> our Saviour promis'd before ſhould be given to him; <hi>Joh.</hi> xv. 26. <hi>When the Comforter is come, whom I will ſend unto you from the Father, even the Spirit of Truth which proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth from the Father, he ſhall teſtifie of me:</hi> And the Teſtimony indeed was very plain and full; for by this it clearly appear'd that all his former Miracles had been true, and had been wrought by a divine Power, when even after he had left this World, he was ſtill able to make good this Promiſe to his Diſciples, and to empower them to do greater Works in his Name, than he himſelf had done while he was living upon Earth; This was a clear Demonſtration that he was the beloved Son of the Father, and <hi>was,</hi> as St. <hi>Peter</hi> ſays,<note place="margin">Act. 2.33.</note> 
                     <hi>exalted at God's right hand,</hi> when he did ſhed forth that wonderful power upon his <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> of which all that then dwelt in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> or had come thither from all parts of the World to Worſhip, were Eye and Ear-Witneſſes.</p>
                  <p>And this <hi>Teſtimony</hi> of the <hi>Holy-Ghoſt</hi> was given to our <hi>Saviour,</hi> not at that time only, not one Day and no more, but was continu'd to be given to him all the time of the Apoſtle's Preaching, (who were alſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled to communicate to others by laying on of Hands,<note place="margin">Act. 2.38.8.17.10.44.19.6.</note> the ſame Miraculous Gifts of the Holy-Ghoſt which they themſelves had receiv'd) until they had finiſh'd their Miniſtery, and planted Chriſtian Churches in all the Countries of the then known World.</p>
                  <p>Thus I have briefly mention'd the great <hi>Evidence</hi> that the <hi>Goſpel Hiſtory</hi> affords of the <hi>Truth</hi> of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's <hi>Teſtimony</hi> of <hi>himſelf;</hi> the <hi>Matters</hi> of <hi>Fact</hi> I have taken for granted, as being parts of the <hi>Goſpel-Hiſtory;</hi> the Truth of which has been, I hope, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſufficiently prov'd; and the Evidence it ſelf is
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:52663:97"/> ſo clear and full, that I thought it needleſs to open it in more Words than I have done; for that the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony which <hi>God</hi> did by all theſe ways give to our <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,</hi> is a rational Inducement to believe the Truth of what he ſaid concerning himſelf, is what I think, can't be doubted by thoſe that allow themſelves any time to conſider things.</p>
                  <p>This I'm ſure I may ſay, that if this ſtrong Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence that the <hi>Goſpel-Hiſtory</hi> affords of our Saviour's divine Miſſion be not ſufficient to prove it, there ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver yet has been ſufficient Evidence of the Truth of any divine Revelation; I had almoſt ſaid, nor ever can be, but that I know it is not for us to ſay, what Infinite Power and Wiſdom can do.</p>
                  <p>But as ſome <hi>Jews</hi> in our Saviour's time ſaid,<note place="margin">Joh. 7.31.</note> 
                     <hi>when Chriſt cometh, will he do more Miracles than theſe which this Man hath done?</hi> So I may ask, and I believe it will be very difficult to make anſwer to it, <hi>when Chriſt cometh</hi> (if indeed <hi>he</hi> be not already come, if indeed that <hi>Jeſus</hi> on whom we believe be not <hi>he</hi>) how ſhall we do to know him? What greater Aſſurance can he give us that he is the <hi>Chriſt,</hi> than <hi>Jeſus</hi> hath given? What better Reaſon can we ever have to believe any Meſſenger that ſhall be ſent from <hi>God,</hi> than we have to believe our <hi>Saviour?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For we have as much Reaſon, (ſuppoſing the <hi>Goſpel-Hiſtory</hi> to be true) to believe <hi>him</hi> to be ſent from <hi>God,</hi> as we have to believe any thing; we are as ſecure that we are not deceiv'd in <hi>him,</hi> as we are that we are not deceiv'd in the plaineſt Matters of ſenſe. For the beſt, the only ſecurity that we have that our ſenſes do not deceive us, and that every thing in the World is not quite otherwiſe than it appears to us to be, is the <hi>Goodneſs</hi> of <hi>God;</hi> and this ſame ſecurity we have that
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:52663:98"/> we are not deceiv'd in our Saviour's divine Miſſion. Nay we are more ſecure of this than we are of that; becauſe it is more plainly inconſiſtent with the Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God, to deceive us in a Matter on which our everlaſting Welfare depends, than in Matters only of this Life, which are the chief things for which our bodily Senſes are of uſe to us: And if indeed we are deceiv'd in our <hi>Saviour,</hi> it muſt be ſaid that <hi>God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf</hi> has deceiv'd us, having given us all the Reaſon imaginable to believe <hi>him</hi> to be, as he ſaid he was, the <hi>Son</hi> of <hi>God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And now having been ſo large in ſhewing the <hi>Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi> that there is from the <hi>Matters</hi> of <hi>Fact</hi> recorded in the <hi>Hiſtory</hi> of the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> that our <hi>Saviour himſelf</hi> was a <hi>Teacher ſent from God,</hi> I ſhall not need to ſpend much time in ſhewing that his <hi>Apoſtles</hi> were likewiſe <hi>Commiſſion'd</hi> by <hi>God</hi> to inſtruct the World; and conſequently that we ought alſo to receive all the Doctrines taught by <hi>them</hi> (whether in their <hi>Epiſtles,</hi> or in their <hi>Diſcourſes,</hi> interwoven by St. <hi>Luke</hi> with his <hi>Hiſtory</hi> of their <hi>Acts</hi>) as true and divine; for—</p>
                  <p n="1">1. There is plainly no Reaſon why we ſhould not receive them as ſuch; becauſe they are the very <hi>ſame</hi> that our Saviour taught, and <hi>no other.</hi> Some Points of Chriſtian Doctrine are indeed more largely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd and handled by the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> in their Epiſtles, than they are in thoſe Diſcourſes of our Saviour that are recorded by the <hi>Evangeliſts;</hi> but between the <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines</hi> taught by our <hi>Lord himſelf,</hi> and thoſe taught by the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> there is ſuch a perfect <hi>Harmony</hi> and <hi>Agreement,</hi> that if we had only their own Word for it, that they ſpake and wrote by the Inſpiration of the Spirit, we might ſecurely believe them; for tho' one Man may, without Inſpiration, ſay the ſame thing

If there be any Doctrines taught by the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> which we do not ſee were taught before by our <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,</hi> I ſay there is however from the <hi>Hiſtory</hi> of the <hi>Goſpel, Evidence enough</hi> of <hi>their</hi> divine Miſſion alſo; ſo that we may very ſecurely take upon their Credit, as true and divine, any Doctrine which they have inſtructed us in.

                  <p n="1">(1.) That they were <hi>ſent</hi> by our <hi>Saviour,</hi> is paſt all Diſpute, if the <hi>Goſpel-Hiſtory</hi> be true; <hi>Joh.</hi> xx. 21. <hi>As my Father hath ſent me, ſo ſend I you;</hi> and again, <hi>Mat.</hi> xxviii. 19, 20. <hi>Go ye and diſciple all Nations, Baptizing them in the Name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghoſt, teaching them to obſerve all things whatſoever I have commanded you.</hi> And that he had Authority to grant them ſuch a Commiſſion, he ſhews in the words before; <hi>All Power is given unto me in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and in Earth; Go ye therefore and teach all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> &amp;c.

                  <p n="2">(2.) That they were <hi>taught</hi> by <hi>God,</hi> and <hi>enlightned</hi> by his <hi>Holy Spirit,</hi> is what can't be doubted, if we believe the power of our Saviour, and the Truth of the Goſpel; for before our <hi>Lord</hi> went from them,<note place="margin">Joh 20.22.</note> 
                     <hi>he breathed on them, and ſaid, Receive ye the Holy Ghoſt:</hi> And to what <hi>Purpoſes</hi> the <hi>Holy-Ghoſt</hi> was to be given them, he had told them before;<note place="margin">Joh. 14.26.</note> 
                     <hi>The Comforter which is the Holy Ghoſt whom the Father will ſend in my Name, he ſhall teach you all things, and bring all things to your Remembrance whatſoever I have ſaid unto you.</hi> And, <hi>when he, the Spirit of Truth is come,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Joh. 16.13.</note>

<pb n="30" facs="tcp:52663:99"/> into all Truth;</hi> being thus therefore taught by the Spirit of Truth, our <hi>Saviour</hi> might well ſay as he does, <hi>Luke</hi> x. 16. <hi>He that heareth you, heareth me; and he that deſpiſeth you deſpiſeth me; and he that deſpiſeth me, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſeth him that ſent me.</hi> And,</p>
                  <p n="3">(3.) Laſtly; We have all the reaſon in the World to receive <hi>them</hi> as <hi>Meſſengers</hi> from <hi>God,</hi> and to believe that all that they have taught is the Will of God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they had the <hi>ſame Atteſtation</hi> of <hi>God</hi> to the truth of their Doctrine, that our Saviour himſelf had to his. I do not mean that <hi>God</hi> did bear them Witneſs <hi>all</hi> thoſe ways by which he bare witneſs to our <hi>Saviour,</hi> for that could not be; but he bare witneſs to them all thoſe ways by which it was proper for him to do it, and by which he had born witneſs to any former Prophets.</p>
                  <p>For he bare witneſs to them that they were ſent by him,<note place="margin">Joh. 13.22.20, 21.</note> by the <hi>Teſtimony</hi> of our <hi>Saviour,</hi> as he had done to our <hi>Saviour</hi> by the <hi>Teſtimony</hi> of <hi>John:</hi> And if the Teſtimony of a <hi>Prophet</hi> was credible concerning our Saviour, much more is the Teſtimony of the <hi>Son of God</hi> highly credible concerning a Meſſenger ſent by him.</p>
                  <p>He bare witneſs to them alſo by enduing them with the <hi>Gift</hi> of <hi>Prophecy;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Joh. 16.13.</note> for <hi>when the Spirit of Truth is come,</hi> ſays our Saviour, <hi>he will ſhew you things to come.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And laſtly, he bare witneſs to them, by that which is the moſt plain and ſenſible proof of a divine Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,<note place="margin">Mar. 16.20.</note> 
                     <hi>viz.</hi> By the <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>Miracles,</hi> and manifold <hi>Gifts</hi> of the <hi>Holy-Ghoſt. The Lord worked with them, and confirmed their word with Signs following,</hi> ſays St. <hi>Mark.</hi> And, <hi>with great Power,</hi> ſays St. <hi>Luke, gave</hi>

                     <pb n="31" facs="tcp:52663:99"/> And the greater part of the <hi>Hiſtory</hi> of the <hi>Acts of the Apoſtles</hi> is ſpent in relating the wonderful Works that they did, by the Name of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> and the Power of the <hi>Holy-Ghoſt,</hi> in confirmation of the Truth of their Doctrine.</p>
                  <p>But St. <hi>Paul</hi> (perhaps it will be ſaid) of whoſe Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting are moſt of the <hi>Epiſtles,</hi> was not one of <hi>them,</hi> not <hi>called</hi> by our <hi>Saviour</hi> to be an <hi>Apoſtle</hi> as <hi>they</hi> were, nor ſo much as an Eye and Ear-witneſs of our Lord's Miracles and Doctrine; what Reaſon then have we to receive <hi>his</hi> Writings as Portions of <hi>Holy Scripture?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I anſwer, as good, tho' not in every particular juſt the ſame that we have to receive the Writings of the other <hi>Apoſtles</hi> as ſuch.</p>
                  <p>For <hi>he</hi> was Converted, and Ordain'd to be an <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle,</hi> in a more wonderful manner than they were; as you may ſee in <hi>Acts</hi> 9.</p>

                  <p>And Laſtly; His <hi>Speech and his Preaching was,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Cor. 2.4. 2 Cor. 12.12.</note> as theirs, <hi>in Demonſtration of the Spirit, and of Power.</hi> In <hi>him</hi> all the <hi>Signs of an Apoſtle</hi> were ſeen, no leſs than in them, <hi>viz. Signs and Wonders, and mighty Deeds.</hi> And of <hi>him,</hi> with <hi>Barnabas</hi> in Company,<note place="margin">Acts 14.3.</note> it is that St. <hi>Luke</hi> ſpeaks, when he ſays, that <hi>the Lord gave Teſtimony to the word of his Grace, and granted
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:52663:100"/> Signs and Wonders to be done by their Hands.</hi> And the latter part of the <hi>Hiſtory</hi> of the <hi>Acts,</hi> from the 10th Chapter to the End, contains little elſe but an account of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Preaching, and of the <hi>Miracles</hi> that were done by the Power of <hi>God</hi> to confirm the Truth of <hi>his</hi> Doctrine; So that if we believe the <hi>Goſpel-Hiſtory,</hi> we can no more doubt of <hi>his</hi> divine Miſſion and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration than we can of <hi>theirs;</hi> we muſt conclude, that if <hi>they</hi> were <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> ſo was <hi>he;</hi> that if <hi>they</hi> were <hi>Miniſters of Chriſt,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 Cor. 11.23. 2 Cor. 11.5. 2 Cor. 12.11.</note> ſo was <hi>he</hi> too; foraſmuch as in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing <hi>he</hi> was <hi>behind the very chiefeſt Apoſtles;</hi> ſo that conſequently we have as much Reaſon to believe <hi>his</hi> Writings to be Inſpired, as we have <hi>theirs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And now by all that hath been ſaid, I hope, I have fully made good the Point I was to prove; <hi>viz.</hi> That if the Matters of Fact recorded in the New Teſtament are true, <hi>they</hi> are <hi>ſufficient Proofs</hi> of the <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Authority</hi> of all the <hi>Doctrines</hi> that are therein taught, whether by <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf, or by his <hi>Apoſtles.</hi> For if it be true that they were <hi>ſent</hi> by <hi>God</hi> to inſtruct the World, and to declare the Will of <hi>God</hi> to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind; (and that they were, is ſufficiently prov'd by their <hi>Credential Letters,</hi> which we have now peruſed and examin'd) we can no more doubt the truth of thoſe things which <hi>they,</hi> as the <hi>Meſſengers</hi> and <hi>Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadors</hi> of <hi>God</hi> have deliver'd to us in his Name, than if we had heard <hi>God</hi> himſelf uttering the ſame by a <hi>Voice</hi> from <hi>Heaven.</hi> So that I cannot but perſwade my ſelf that the <hi>Proofs</hi> which have been offer'd in the forego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Diſcourſe of the <hi>Truth</hi> of all the <hi>Doctrines</hi> that are taught in the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> are <hi>ſufficient</hi> to convince any Rational and Conſidering Man of the <hi>Truth</hi> of <hi>any Doctrine,</hi> the <hi>Falſity</hi> whereof is not <hi>Notorious</hi> and <hi>Self-evident.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="33" facs="tcp:52663:100"/>
                  <p>And therefore this, I think, is the only thing that can with any ſhew of Reaſon be pretended by any Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to juſtifie his not receiving the Goſpel as a divine Revelation, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Matter of it, in ſome Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars, is ſuch as will not admit of any Proof at all; becauſe no Arguments can make a thing credible, which in it ſelf is <hi>incredible.</hi> And ſuch, it may be pretended, ſome of the Chriſtian Doctrines are which are taught in the <hi>New Teſtament;</hi> and eſpecially the Doctrine of the <hi>Trinity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And that this Doctrine is clearly taught in the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> we freely grant. But why ſhould it be deem'd <hi>incredible?</hi> Does it imply a Contradiction? Can they that except againſt it, or againſt the <hi>Goſpel-Revelation</hi> upon the Account of it, ſhew that it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible it ſhould be true? Can they demonſtrate that 'tis impoſſible for an Infinite and Eternal Being to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get a Son in his own Likeneſs,<note place="margin">Heb. 1.3.</note> 
                     <hi>the brightneſs of his Glory, and the expreſs Image of his Perſon?</hi> Or can they ſhew it to be impoſſible that there ſhould be a third Perſon proceeding from both theſe?</p>
                  <p>No, perhaps they'll ſay; But that theſe <hi>three</hi> ſhould be <hi>one,</hi> as the Scripture teaches, <hi>that,</hi> they think, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds all the Meaſures of Belief; <hi>that,</hi> they can't but think a manifeſt <hi>Contradiction.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But why ſo? Do the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> hold, or does the <hi>Scripture</hi> ſay, that they are <hi>three</hi> and <hi>one</hi> in the <hi>ſame reſpect?</hi> does it ſay that the <hi>one God</hi> is <hi>three Gods;</hi> or that thoſe <hi>three</hi> whom it ſpeaks of as <hi>three diſtinct Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,</hi> aſcribing perſonal Acts to each of them, are never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs but <hi>one ſingle Perſon?</hi> No, it only tells us in general that <hi>theſe three are One.</hi> But <hi>how</hi> they are <hi>Three,</hi> or <hi>how</hi> they are <hi>One;</hi> wherein conſiſts their <hi>Diſtinction,</hi> and wherein their <hi>Unity,</hi> it ſays not, at
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:52663:101"/> leaſt not very plainly. And I think it the ſafeſt Courſe in ſuch high Matters,<note place="margin">Pſal. 131.1.</note> in <hi>Matters</hi> ſo much <hi>too high for us, not to exerciſe our ſelves,</hi> nor to pretend to be Wiſe above what is written.</p>
                  <p>If therefore there be no Contradiction in the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of <hi>a Trinity in Unity;</hi> (as there is not unleſs we ſay that <hi>God</hi> is <hi>One</hi> and <hi>Three</hi> in the <hi>ſame Reſpect</hi>) that's enough; that's all that needs to be ſaid upon this Occaſion. For tho' we may (as indeed we muſt) allow it to be an <hi>incomprehenſible Myſtery,</hi> there is no Reaſon to Cavil at the <hi>Goſpel-Revelation,</hi> or to deny it to be a true divine Revelation upon this Account.</p>
                  <p>For we live in a World of <hi>Myſteries;</hi> we muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve <hi>Myſteries</hi> in abundance whether we will or no; I mean, there are ſome Truths ſo very plain even to our Reaſon that we can't doubt of them, and yet ſo very high and <hi>Myſterious,</hi> that we can no more fathom them than we can the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of the <hi>Trinity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For thus, that <hi>Matter</hi> is <hi>not Eternal,</hi> we are as ſure almoſt as we are of any thing, for Matter could not exiſt of it ſelf; and yet how <hi>Matter</hi> ſhould be made out of <hi>nothing,</hi> is as incomprehenſible by us, as 'tis how the <hi>One</hi> undivided <hi>Godhead</hi> does perſonally ſubſiſt in the <hi>Father, Son</hi> and <hi>Holy-Ghoſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And thus again, that <hi>God</hi> is <hi>Eternal</hi> we are certain by Reaſon; (for by <hi>God</hi> we mean the firſt Cauſe of all, and he who was firſt could have none before him) and yet that any thing ſhould exiſt without a <hi>Cauſe</hi> of its <hi>Exiſtence</hi> is unaccountable; and if we were not ſure that it muſt be ſo, we ſhould be ready to ſay that it was impoſſible, and a manifeſt Contradiction that it ſhould be ſo.</p>
                  <p>Thus, I ſay, we are led by the Light of Reaſon only to a firm belief of ſome Truths, which yet we can
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:52663:101"/> give no Account of by our Reaſon; and I think, 'tis very hard that we will not receive an incomprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Doctrine, upon the Credit of a very plain and well atteſted Divine Revelation, as well as we do and muſt do the ſame upon the Evidence of Natural Reaſon.</p>
                  <p>Eſpecially conſidering the <hi>Subject</hi> of this incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſible Doctrine, which is the <hi>Eſſence</hi> or <hi>Subſtance</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> who is an <hi>Infinite</hi> Being and ſo muſt needs be <hi>incomprehenſible</hi> by our <hi>finite Underſtandings;</hi> by our Underſtandings, I ſay, which are ſo very <hi>ſhallow,</hi> that I believe I may truly ſay, we underſtand not the <hi>Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence</hi> or <hi>Subſtance</hi> of any thing. For we underſtand not what is the <hi>Eſſence</hi> or <hi>Subſtance</hi> of <hi>Matter</hi> or <hi>Body,</hi> tho' it be a thing that all our Senſes are continually exerciſed about; all that we know of it, is ſome <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties</hi> or <hi>Accidents</hi> thereof; that it is ſomething (but <hi>what</hi> we know not) that has Figure and Dimenſions, that is hard, ſoft, fix'd, fluid or the like. And we underſtand no more, but rather leſs, what the <hi>Eſſence</hi> or <hi>Subſtance</hi> of our <hi>Soul</hi> is; all that we know of it, is, that 'tis ſomething that <hi>thinks,</hi> and becauſe it thinks we know it muſt be <hi>ſomething;</hi> and becauſe none of thoſe Properties which we obſerve in Matter, have any Relation at all to <hi>Thought,</hi> we conclude that the <hi>thinking Soul</hi> is an <hi>immaterial Something;</hi> tho' what is <hi>immaterial</hi> cannot be explain'd by us, unleſs we could ſay what is <hi>material.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Seeing therefore (as the Wiſe <hi>Hebrew</hi> ſpeaks) <hi>we do hardly gueſs aright at things that are upon Earth,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Wiſd. 9.16.</note> 
                     <hi>and with Labour do find out the things that are before us;</hi> is it any wonder that we cannot <hi>ſearch out,</hi> and fully know and comprehend <hi>the things that are in Heaven?</hi> If we are not able to underſtand even our own <hi>Eſſence,</hi> and how by an ineffable Union of Spirit with Matter,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:52663:102"/> the whole together becomes <hi>one Man,</hi> is it any Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,<note place="margin">Job 11.7.</note> that by all our <hi>Searching</hi> we <hi>cannot find out God, that we cannot find out the Almighty unto Perfection?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And what hath been thus briefly ſaid, is, I hope, ſufficient to ſhew that a Divine Revelation cannot reaſonably be excepted againſt or refuſed, only upon the Account of ſome Myſterious and Incomprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Doctrines that are therein contain'd. And if not, then, I hope, what was ſaid before is enough to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie any conſidering Man, that the Goſpel is a true Divine Revelation.</p>
                  <p>To Conclude all therefore; having <hi>Chriſt and his Apoſtles</hi> continually <hi>Preaching</hi> to us in the <hi>Books</hi> of the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Jam. 1.21, 22.</note> 
                     <hi>Let us</hi> (as the Text ſays) <hi>hear them;</hi> Let us Reverence theſe Sacred Writings as the <hi>Oracles</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and <hi>receive with Meekneſs the engrafted Word, which is able to ſave our Souls. But let us be Doers of the Word, and not Hearers only, deceiving our own ſelves.</hi> For, (as the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> argues, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.3, &amp;c.) <hi>If the word ſpoken by Angels was ſtedfaſt, and every Tranſgreſſion and Diſobedience receiv'd a juſt Recompence of Reward; How ſhall we eſcape, if we neglect ſo great Salvation, which at the firſt began to be ſpoken by the Lord, and was confirmed unto us by them that heard him, God alſo bearing them witneſs both with Signs and Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and with divers Miracles and Gifts of the Holy-Ghoſt, according to his own Will?</hi>

                     <p>And he ſaid, Nay, father Abraham: but if one went unto them from the dead, they will repent.</p>
                     <p>And he ſaid unto him, If they hear not Moſes and the Prophets, neither will they be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded, though one roſe from the dead.</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>VVHEN I firſt began to Diſcourſe on theſe Words; I propoſed to ſpeak to theſe three Points.</p>
                  <p n="1">I. To ſhew that the preſent <hi>Standing Revelation</hi> of God's Will, contain'd in the <hi>Books</hi> of the <hi>Old</hi> and <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> is abundantly <hi>ſufficient</hi> to perſuade Men to Repentance, if they are not unreaſonably blind and obſtinate. <hi>They have Moſes and the Prophets;</hi> (I add, <hi>they have alſo Chriſt and his Apoſtles;) let them hear them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">II. To ſhew that having already ſuch good Grounds of Faith, ſuch full Directions for Practice, and ſuch ſtrong Motives to Repentance, it is an <hi>unreaſonable Requeſt</hi> to <hi>deſire more. Nay, Father Abraham, but if one went unto them from the dead, they will repent.</hi> And,</p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <pb n="4" facs="tcp:52663:104"/>III. Laſtly, To ſhew that in caſe God ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcend to gratifie Men in this unreaſonable Deſire, (working every Day new Miracles before their Eyes, or ſending their deceaſed Friends to them from the dead, to aſſure them of a future State, and to warn them to prepare for it) 'tis highly <hi>probable</hi> that very few or none of thoſe who do not believe, and are not brought to Repentance, by the Preaching and Standing Revelation of the Goſpel, would be <hi>perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded</hi> by <hi>this means. If they hear not Moſes and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets (nor Chriſt and his Apoſtles) neither will they be perſuaded tho' one roſe from the dead.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The firſt of theſe has been the ſubject of ſeveral former Diſcourſes; the ſecond I deſign to ſpeak to at this time; <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">II. To ſhew that having already ſuch good Grounds of Faith, ſuch full Directions for Practice, and ſuch ſtrong Motives to Repentance, as I have ſhewn we have, in that <hi>Standing Revelation</hi> of God's Will which is contained in the <hi>Holy Scripture,</hi> it is an <hi>unreaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Requeſt to deſire more. Nay, Father Abraham, but if one went unto them from the dead, they will repent.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And the <hi>Unreaſonableneſs</hi> of the Requeſt which the <hi>Rich Man</hi> here makes in the behalf of his Brethren; <hi>viz.</hi> That God would be pleaſed to ſend one from the dead to preach to them; or in general, how <hi>unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable</hi> it is for men now a-days to <hi>deſire,</hi> or <hi>look for</hi> more means of Converſion, or Motives to Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, than God has been pleaſed to afford us in the Standing Revelation of the Goſpel, will appear, if we conſider theſe following things.</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <pb n="5" facs="tcp:52663:104"/>1. That the Principles of Faith and the Motives to Repentance which we have already, being well grounded upon <hi>Matters</hi> of <hi>Fact,</hi> which have been <hi>once</hi> already <hi>ſufficiently</hi> prov'd and atteſted, 'tis altogether <hi>needleſs</hi> that any freſh or further Proof ſhould be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of them; and 'tis what we never think reaſonable to deſire in other the like Caſes.</p>
                  <p>That when God requires us to believe or do any thing, and ſends a ſpecial Meſſenger to acquaint us with his Will, he ſhould grant to this Meſſenger ſuch <hi>Teſtimonials,</hi> as are ſufficient to ſatisfie reaſonable Men that he is no Impoſtor, but a Teacher ſent from God, is indeed a thing that may fairly be expected. And if God ſhould not do thus, we ſhould be excuſable in not hearkning to ſuch a Meſſenger, becauſe we could not know whether he was a true or a falſe Prophet; and God does not require, neither indeed is it reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable that we ſhould believe every Pretender to Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation. And the cleareſt Proof of any Man's being ſent from God to teach us any thing, being a Power of doing ſuch Miracles and Mighty Works, as are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly above the skill and ſtrength of a Man to do, it was therefore highly requiſite, and what might rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably be look'd for, that God ſhould grant ſuch a Power as this to all thoſe whom he has ever inſpired with new Light, and Commiſſion'd to make any new Revelation of his Will to Mankind. And this he has always done.</p>
                  <p>He gave this Power to <hi>Moſes</hi> in a large meaſure, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Matters that Men were to truſt him for, were <hi>many,</hi> and very <hi>conſiderable.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He gave it alſo to <hi>ſome</hi> of the <hi>ſucceeding Prophets,</hi> but in a leſs meaſure, becauſe their Buſineſs, for the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:52663:105"/> moſt part, was only to Interpret, or to preſs the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> which had been ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently prov'd before.</p>
                  <p>And he gave it in the largeſt meaſure of all to our <hi>Saviour</hi> and his <hi>Apoſtles;</hi> becauſe the Revelation made by them was of <hi>Truths</hi> very <hi>myſterious,</hi> ſome of them above the Reach and Comprehenſion of Humane Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; It was alſo a Revelation, in a manner wholly <hi>new,</hi> even to the <hi>Jews</hi> themſelves, and much more to the <hi>Gentiles.</hi> And beſides, it was a Revelation in many Points, to appearance, <hi>contrary</hi> to a former Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Revelation; inaſmuch as it ordered the Abolition of many things which had been before enjoyned by divine Authority; <hi>viz.</hi> all the Ritual and Ceremonial Law of <hi>Moſes.</hi> And therefore to gain Credit to their Teſtimony, that they were inſpired and ſent by God to teach ſuch things, it was very requiſite that they ſhould produce more, and more plain and undeniable <hi>Teſtimonials</hi> of their divine Miſſion, than <hi>Moſes</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf had done. And ſuch Teſtimonials they had, ſuch they did produce, working more Miracles, and thoſe as I may ſay, more wonderful and Miraculous, than <hi>Moſes</hi> and all the <hi>Prophets</hi> together had wrought be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
                  <p>But when theſe Teſtimonials had been <hi>once</hi> fairly <hi>produced,</hi> and <hi>examined,</hi> and by all reaſonable Men <hi>allowed</hi> to be true and ſufficient; and when <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his <hi>Apoſtles</hi> had <hi>made</hi> and <hi>publiſhed</hi> all that Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which they were Commiſſioned to make; And when to prevent all miſunderſtandings of it, or mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtakes concerning it, they had <hi>committed</hi> it all to <hi>Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting;</hi> and the Men that lived in thoſe times, and were capable of enquiring into the Truth of it, were well
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:52663:105"/> 
                     <hi>aſſured</hi> that the <hi>Books</hi> ſaid to be written by the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles</hi> and <hi>Evangeliſts,</hi> were indeed <hi>theirs,</hi> and contain'd in ſubſtance all the ſame things, and no other, which they had before declared by word of Mouth, and confirmed by Miracles; After this, I ſay, when the Divinity of the Revelation was thus <hi>once,</hi> at the firſt Publiſhing of it, ſo fully confirmed, there was no <hi>need</hi> that it ſhould be proved any more, and all other Proof thereof would have been <hi>ſuperfluous;</hi> becauſe the whole Matter, both Doctrine and Proof, being <hi>once</hi> faithfully <hi>recorded,</hi> and thoſe Records well <hi>at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted,</hi> there could afterwards be no reaſonable Cauſe to call it again in Queſtion. So that the Reaſon of working Miracles being then ceaſed, it was reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that the Power of working Miracles ſhould ceaſe too; at leaſt till ſuch time as God ſhould think fit, to make ſome Alteration in, or Addition to his former Revelations; (which we have good Reaſon to think he will never do) or 'till he ſhould pleaſe to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take the Converſion of thoſe Nations to the Chriſtian Faith, to whom the Knowledge of the former Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles that had been wrought for its Confirmation could not be ſo well communicated by credible Hiſtory as it is to us.</p>
                  <p>For (as was hinted before) <hi>Credible Hiſtory</hi> is all the Proof and Evidence that we ever think <hi>reaſonable</hi> to require in <hi>other</hi> Caſes of the like Nature.</p>
                  <p>As for inſtance; When a new Law is made con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning any Matter; it is requiſite, according to the Cuſtom of our Country, that it ſhould paſs both <hi>Houſes</hi> of <hi>Parliament,</hi> and that the <hi>King</hi> ſhould ratifie and confirm it; and that afterwards it ſhould be ſome way ſo publiſhed and promulged, that all the Subjects
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:52663:106"/> that are then alive ſhould have ſufficient Aſſurance given them that ſuch a Law is made. But after this Law has been once ſo paſſed, and ratified and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulged, it is paſſed and ratified and promulged for ever; and no Man is ſo unreaſonable as to expect that every <hi>Parliament</hi> that is called afterwards, ſhould read and paſs over again all the Laws that have been made before their Time; or that every <hi>King</hi> that ſucceeds to the Throne ſhould afreſh ratifie and publiſh all the Laws that were made by all his <hi>Predeceſſors.</hi> But all the Proof that we ever require of the Authority of any ancient Law, is a true Copy of it, and a good Hiſtory or Record of its being made at ſuch a time, by ſuch a King, confirmed by the Tradition of all the intermediate Ages to our Time, which have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed of its Authority, by citing it as a Law of the Land, by Pleading from it, and by giving Judgment according to it.</p>
                  <p>And he who will not allow of the ſame Proof and Evidence of the Authority of the Chriſtian Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſo many hundred years ago eſtabliſhed, but would needs have new Miracles and new Revelations to confirm the former, is every whit as unreaſonable as that <hi>Criminal</hi> would be, who being Indicted upon ſome <hi>Ancient Statute,</hi> ſhould refuſe to plead to his Indictment, upon Pretence that he knew not whether there was any ſuch Law or not; it being made (if ever it was made) long before his Time, and there being none now alive that were preſent at the making of it. Shew him the Law in the <hi>Statute Book;</hi> why, how does he know, he'd ſay, but that the Printers had a mind to put a Cheat upon the Nation, by Printing a Law of their own making, as a Law made
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:52663:106"/> by ſome of our ancient Kings; nay ſhew him the <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Record,</hi> ſtill he'd ſay, There have been abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of Forgeries in the World, and how does he know but that this is one? The Record he'd own perhaps, looks like an Ancient Deed, and has all the Marks of ſuch Antiquity as it pretends to; but after all, 'tis poſſible it may be, and therefore he cannot be ſure it is not a Forgery; and 'till he is aſſured of this, he will not plead to an Indictment that is grounded upon it. But if the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Parliament</hi> that now are, will be pleaſed to declare that this is a good Law, and if he himſelf may be allowed to be by when they ſhall declare it; or if at leaſt two or three Witneſſes that he can trust ſhall teſtifie upon Oath, that they were preſent when it was paſſed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Law, then he will allow it to be a good Law; and after that, will be content to ſuffer the Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it, if he ſhall ever again be a Tranſgreſſor.</p>
                  <p>Now what Man is there that would think this a reaſonable Demand? Or what <hi>Judge</hi> or <hi>Court</hi> would ever allow of ſuch a Plea? And yet, as unreaſonable as it is, it is juſt the ſame with theirs, who pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be more wiſe and cautious than their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, will not allow of the ſame ſort of Proof (tho' indeed much better in its kind) of the Truth of the Chriſtian Religion; but tho' we have as <hi>Authentick Hiſtories</hi> as any are in the World, (ſuch Hiſtories as the greateſt Adverſaries of Chriſtianity have not been able to ſay any thing to invalidate the Truth of) which declare that <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his <hi>Apoſtles</hi> taught ſuch and ſuch Doctrines, and wrought ſuch and ſuch Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles to confirm the Truth of their Doctrine, yet will not believe that the Doctrine of Chriſtianity is true
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:52663:107"/> and Divine, unleſs they may have ſpecial Meſſengers ſent to them to declare a-freſh all the ſame things which the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> once did; and thoſe endued with a Power of working in their ſight and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence the ſame Miracles over again, that are ſaid to have been formerly done by <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> to confirm the Teſtimony that they gave.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The <hi>Unreaſonableneſs</hi> of that Requeſt which the <hi>Rich Man</hi> here makes in the Behalf of his Brethren, <hi>viz.</hi> That God would make a new Revelation for their particular Converſion; or, in general, The <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonableneſs</hi> of our now <hi>deſiring freſh Revelations; new Miracles</hi> or <hi>Apparitions</hi> of Men from the dead, to confirm the Truth of thoſe things which are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſufficiently proved to us by the <hi>Standing Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation</hi> of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> will further appear, if we conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; That to <hi>us</hi> who live now in <hi>Chriſtian Countries, other</hi> Grounds of Faith or <hi>ſtronger</hi> Motives to Repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance than we have already in the ſtanding Revelation of the Goſpel might be <hi>inconſiſtent</hi> with the <hi>Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency</hi> of <hi>Faith,</hi> might <hi>deſtroy</hi> the <hi>Virtue</hi> of <hi>Believing,</hi> and might be too great a <hi>Force</hi> and <hi>Conſtraint</hi> upon us, ſuch as would in a manner take away our <hi>Liberty</hi> of <hi>Choice.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For there is no Virtue at all in Believing what we ſee; there is no Praiſe or Thanks at all due for do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what we are driven or forced to do; and for <hi>us,</hi> who have <hi>already</hi> abundantly ſufficient Grounds to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve and embrace <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> to have freſh Miracles wrought every day before our own eyes (ſuch Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles as we could not poſſibly doubt the Truth of) to confirm thoſe Doctrines which are already ſufficiently confirmed, would not be to perſuade us, but to <hi>force</hi>
                     <pb n="11" facs="tcp:52663:107"/> us to be <hi>Chiſtians;</hi> ſo that then the State we are now in would not be, as God deſigned it ſhould be, a State of <hi>Trial;</hi> for the <hi>Trial</hi> of <hi>Wiſdom</hi> is, when there are ſome Reaſons on both ſides; and he is the Wiſe Man who in that Caſe gives Judgment on that ſide on which the Reaſons are ſtrongeſt.</p>
                  <p>But againſt what I have now ſaid perhaps it may be objected, That the Evidence which we deſire of the Truth of Religion is <hi>no more</hi> than we are told has been <hi>already</hi> given to ſome Men; particularly to thoſe who lived in our <hi>Saviour</hi>'s and his <hi>Apoſtle</hi>'s times, and we can't ſee why it would be <hi>more</hi> inconſiſtent with the Nature of Faith and Religion <hi>now</hi> than it was <hi>then,</hi> or how it would <hi>more</hi> deſtroy <hi>our Freedom</hi> than it did <hi>theirs,</hi> or how it would be a <hi>greater Force</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>our Choice</hi> than it was upon <hi>theirs,</hi> to have the very <hi>ſame</hi> Evidence of the Truth of the Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion which they had.</p>
                  <p>But in anſwer to this, it may be conſider'd; that as <hi>they</hi> then had ſome Evidence of the Truth of the Chriſtian Religion which <hi>we</hi> have not, ſo <hi>we</hi> now have ſome Evidence thereof which <hi>they</hi> had not: <hi>They</hi> indeed ſaw with their own Eyes <hi>ſome</hi> of the Miracles that were wrought for the Confirmation of Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; but <hi>they</hi> had not, as <hi>we</hi> now have, a credible Hiſtory or Record of a very <hi>great number</hi> of Miracles that were wrought for that purpoſe. And therefore (without conſidering at preſent which of theſe Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences of the Truth of the Facts upon which our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion is grounded, is the moſt convincing) thus much is plain; That if <hi>we,</hi> who have already very good Reaſon to believe them upon the Credit of a well at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted Hiſtory, were alſo admitted to be Eye Witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:52663:108"/> of ſome freſh Miracles, ſuch as we are told were then wrought, <hi>both</hi> theſe Evidences together would be ſtronger and more irreſiſtible, than <hi>either</hi> of them <hi>alone;</hi> So that conſequently, if <hi>we</hi> who have already <hi>one</hi> of theſe Evidences, were allowed to have the <hi>other</hi> alſo, <hi>we</hi> ſhould have <hi>more</hi> Evidence in the whole than <hi>they</hi> had, our Choice conſequently would not be ſo free as theirs was, it would not be ſo much in the Power of our Wills to be <hi>Infidels,</hi> as it was in theirs.</p>
                  <p>True, perhaps you'll ſay, we ſhould indeed in that Caſe have more Evidence than they had, but that is not the thing we deſire; all that we could wiſh for, is, the very <hi>ſame</hi> Evidence that they had; and upon that Condition we could be well contented to want the Hiſtorical Evidence which we have and they had not; for we can't but think, that the Evidence that <hi>they</hi> had is much ſtronger than <hi>ours,</hi> and that <hi>they</hi> had much greater Reaſon to be <hi>Chriſtians</hi> than <hi>we</hi> have. For 1. The <hi>Apoſtles</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> who (as 'tis ſaid) both <hi>ſaw</hi> his Miracles, and were <hi>enabled</hi> by the Power of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> to do the like themſelves, had plainly <hi>greater</hi> Reaſon to believe, than even <hi>thoſe</hi> had who heard from their mouths the Teſtimony that they gave concerning our Lord, and ſaw the Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles that were done by their Hands in Confirmation of their Teſtimony. And 2. <hi>They</hi> who <hi>ſaw</hi> with their <hi>own Eyes</hi> the <hi>Miracles</hi> that the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> wrought had more Reaſon to believe, than <hi>thoſe</hi> had to whom they were only <hi>Reported</hi> by Eye Witneſſes, and therefore much rather than we have who receive this Report only by a <hi>Hiſtory</hi> that was written many hundred years ago. Now this is all that we deſire, <hi>viz.</hi> To
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:52663:108"/> be upon the <hi>ſame Level</hi> with thoſe who lived in the Primitive Times, and to have as <hi>much</hi> Reaſon to be Chriſtians as they had; and we can't ſee why this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt ſhould be thought <hi>unreaſonable;</hi> we do not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand why there would not be then as much Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and conſequently as great Virtue in <hi>our</hi> Believing upon ſuch ſtrong Evidence as there was in <hi>theirs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In Anſwer to this therefore I ſhall conſider di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly the two Caſes before-mentioned, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare the ſame with ours.</p>
                  <p n="1">(1.) I ſhall conſider the Caſe of the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> who both <hi>ſaw</hi> our Lord's Miracles, and were <hi>enabled</hi> by the Power of the <hi>Holy-Ghoſt</hi> to do the like them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
                  <p>And that <hi>they</hi> had a <hi>ſurer</hi> Ground of Faith than any ſince, or than any beſides themſelves ever had, I believe muſt be granted; but then 'tis to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered on the other ſide.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> were but <hi>few</hi> in number, only <hi>twelve</hi> Perſons, or if we ſhould reckon in to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, as in this reſpect, equal to the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> all thoſe that were called by our <hi>Saviour himſelf</hi> to be his <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,</hi> and who were very much, tho' not ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly in his Company as the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> were, we read but of <hi>ſeventy</hi> of them; or if we add to theſe all thoſe that were <hi>convinced</hi> by our Saviours <hi>Miracles</hi> that he was the <hi>Chriſt,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Luke 10.1</note> and that owned themſelves his <hi>Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples</hi> while he was upon Earth, 'tis probable that all theſe together were no more than <hi>five hundred; viz.</hi> thoſe <hi>five hundred Brethren,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Cor. 15.6.</note> to whom when met to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in <hi>Galilee,</hi> our <hi>Lord</hi> ſhewed himſelf alive after his Paſſion.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="14" facs="tcp:52663:109"/>2. It may be alſo conſidered; that <hi>their Caſe</hi> was <hi>extraordinary</hi> and <hi>peculiar,</hi> and that this Advantage of greater Evidence (as we reckon it) which they had above all others was no more than was <hi>neceſſary</hi> to qualifie them for that <hi>ſpecial Office</hi> which they, and none but they were to be employed in; which was to <hi>bear Witneſs</hi> to the Men of that Generation by word of mouth, and to all future Ages by their written Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony, of the Doctrines and Miracles of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour; for no Man is a proper Witneſs of any matter of Fact, but only he who was an <hi>Eye Witneſs</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It may be further conſidered, that as they had a more clear and unexceptionable Evidence of the Truth of Chriſtianity, than any beſides ever had, ſo they had alſo a <hi>greater Burden</hi> laid upon them, than any Chriſtians ſince have had; and it might be no more than <hi>neceſſary</hi> that the Grounds of their Faith ſhould be as much ſurer and ſtronger than thoſe on which other Men's Faith is built, as their <hi>Duty</hi> was <hi>larger</hi> and <hi>more difficult</hi> than other Men's Duty is. For a weaker Foundation is as well able to ſupport a low Building, placed in a Bottom, and well ſheltred from Storms, as a much ſtronger is to bear a high built Tower, ſituated on the top of an Hill, or by the Sea-ſhore, and continually expoſed to violent Winds and Tempeſts.</p>
                  <p>And this was the Condition of the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon with ours. <hi>We</hi> have indeed ſeveral Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to reſiſt by the Power of our moſt holy Faith, but then they are only <hi>ſuch</hi> Temptations <hi>as are common to Men,</hi> and for the overcoming whereof a <hi>Faith</hi> grounded only upon good <hi>Hiſtorical Evidence</hi> is <hi>ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient;</hi>
                     <pb n="15" facs="tcp:52663:109"/> for by the Power of ſuch a Faith a great many in all Ages have happily overcome them; But the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> had Difficulties and Temptations of <hi>another ſort</hi> to contend with; they <hi>wreſtled not only againſt Fleſh and Blood, but againſt Principalities, againſt Powers, againſt the Rulers of the Darkneſs of this World, againſt Spiritual Wickedneſs in high Places.</hi> It was their Buſineſs to go in an untrodden Path, to break the Ice and to make plain the way for all that were to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low; and our Work (very eaſie in compariſon with theirs) is only to follow in that Way, which they have made plain and ſmooth, to that Kingdom of Heaven, into which they could not enter but <hi>thro' manifold Tribulations.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> therefore had ſtronger and more convincing Proofs of the Truth of the Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion than we have, and ſuch as <hi>they</hi> could not ſo ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily reſiſt, as <hi>we</hi> may thoſe which are afforded to us, may be granted; and yet it may be unreaſonable for us to deſire the ſame, unleſs we were to be put to the ſame Trials of our Faith that they were; which in a Chriſtian Country can hardly be.</p>
                  <p>And indeed as deſirous as we ſeem to be of having ſuch Evidence of the Truth of our Religion as we are told the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> had, I believe there are very few of us but had rather be contented with leſs Evidence, than have ſo much as the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> had with its ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendant Burden; which was to travel all the World over, even into the moſt rude and barbarous Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries to plant Chriſtianity; expecting wherever they came Bonds and Afflictions, meeting every where with the moſt violent oppoſition and rougheſt Uſage; encountring every where the greateſt Dangers, and
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:52663:110"/> ſure at laſt to be made a bloody Sacrifice to the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice and Fury of their Perſecutors. How much St. <hi>Paul</hi> alone endured (and 'tis like the Sufferings of the other <hi>Apoſtles</hi> were not much leſs) you may ſee in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> xi. 23, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and yet he was not then come to the end of his Sufferings; <hi>In Labours abundant, in Stripes above meaſure, in Priſons frequent, in Deaths oft; Of the Jews five times received I forty Stripes ſave one; thrice was I beaten with Rods, once was I Stoned, thrice I ſuffered Shipwrack, a Night and a Day I have been in the Deep; in Journeyings often, in Perils of Waters, in Perils of Robbers, in Perils by mine own Countrymen, in Perils by the Heathen, in Perils in the City, in Perils in the Wilderneſs, in Perils in the Sea, in Perils among falſe Brethren; In Wearineſs and Pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, in Watchings often, in Hunger and Thirſt, in Faſtings often, in Cold and Nakedneſs; Beſides thoſe things that are without, that which cometh upon me daily, the Care of all the Churches.</hi> And therefore he might well ſay, as he does, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> iv. 9, &amp;c. <hi>I think that God hath ſet forth us the Apoſtles laſt, as it were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to Death; for we are made a Spectacle to the World, and to Angels, and to Men; we are Fools for Chriſt's ſake—we are weak—we are deſpiſed; even unto this very hour we both hunger and thirſt, and are naked and are buffeted, and have no certain dwelling Place; and labour working with our Hands, being revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led—perſecuted—defamed; we are made as the Filth of the World, and are the Off-ſcowring of all things unto this Day.</hi> It was therefore plainly neceſſary that a Faith which was to undergo theſe ſevere Trials, ſhould be built upon the ſureſt Grounds; but for <hi>us,</hi> and to enable <hi>us</hi> to overcome the World, a Faith
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:52663:110"/> that is founded upon leſs certain Evidence may be <hi>as ſufficient.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">(2.) The Second Caſe before-mentioned was of <hi>thoſe</hi> who <hi>heard</hi> with their <hi>own Ears</hi> the <hi>Teſtimony</hi> which the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> gave concerning our <hi>Lord;</hi> and <hi>ſaw</hi> with their <hi>own Eyes</hi> the wonderful <hi>Works</hi> that they did in Confirmation of their Teſtimony. We could wiſh at leaſt that <hi>we</hi> had ſuch ſtrong Evidence of the Truth of the Chriſtian Religion as <hi>they</hi> had; and if we had, we ſee not why there would not be as much Choice, and conſequently as much Virtue in <hi>our</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving as there was in <hi>theirs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But here it may be conſidered,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That it was the Lot but of very <hi>few,</hi> even of thoſe that lived in the Apoſtles times, except of the <hi>Jews</hi> that dwelt in <hi>Judea,</hi> to <hi>hear</hi> the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, or to <hi>ſee</hi> with their <hi>own Eyes</hi> the <hi>Miracles</hi> that they wrought; and even of theſe there were but <hi>few</hi> that had the opportunity of ſeeing <hi>many</hi> of their mighty Works; ſo that all things conſidered the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence that we have of the Truth of our Religion, if it be not fully equal to, is very little inferior to that which they had; for it being (as has been for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly ſhewn) morally impoſſible that the Goſpel Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory which is now in our Hands ſhould be forged or ſpurious, or corrupted and altered, what can be thought to be wanting in the Clearneſs of the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence that we have (being given in Writing and not by word of Mouth) is made up by the Fulneſs and Abundance of it; we having in the <hi>Writings</hi> of the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> and <hi>Evangeliſts, ſeveral Witneſſes</hi> teſtifying the <hi>ſame Miracles,</hi> and <hi>every one</hi> of them Witneſſing <hi>more</hi> Miracles, than any except thoſe who were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:52663:111"/> Attendants upon our <hi>Lord,</hi> or Companions of the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> were in a Capacity to witneſs. But,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Granting it to be true, that in the Apoſtle's times thoſe to whom the Goſpel was preached, had generally clearer and ſtronger Evidence of the Truth of Chriſtianity than we have now; yet I ſay, even that Evidence of Senſe which they had was not more apt or like to convince and perſuade them, than the Proof which we now have, tho' in it ſelf it be leſs, is to convince and perſuade us.</p>
                  <p>For when Men have already taken up an Opinion, (no matter upon what Grounds) or when by their Worldly Intereſt they are engaged to be of ſuch an Opinion, it can't be expected that the ſame Reaſons, I mean Reaſons of the ſame ſtrength in themſelves, ſhould be ſufficient to perſuade them to alter their O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, which would have ſufficed to have fix'd and eſtabliſh'd them in their former Notions.</p>
                  <p>And this is plainly the Difference between thoſe Times and ours; for when the Revelation of the Goſpel was firſt made by <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> all, both <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> were moſt ſtrongly prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced againſt it, each of them having been bred up in a Perſuaſion that their own way of Worſhip was right, add the <hi>Jews</hi> in particular having had good Aſſurance that their Law given by <hi>Moſes,</hi> (to which the Doctrine of Chriſtianity ſeem'd very oppoſite) had been of Divine Inſtitution. But however, when a Man has been bred up in the Belief of any thing, and has believ'd it a good while, he takes it for grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that he had reaſon to believe it, whether be had ſo or not; ſo that the <hi>Prejudice</hi> againſt <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> was as <hi>powerful,</hi> tho' not altogether ſo <hi>juſt,</hi> in the
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:52663:111"/> 
                     <hi>Gentiles,</hi> whoſe Religion was meerly fabulous, as in the <hi>Jews,</hi> whoſe Law was indeed of Divine Inſtitution.</p>
                  <p>And beſides, (which was an Impediment alike com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon both to the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi>) they could not either of them then embrace and profeſs the Chriſtian Religion without apparently hazarding the Loſs of all things that were dear to them in this World. And how very apt a ſtrong Worldly Intereſt is to blind Mens Eyes and to byaſs their Judgments, is what we cannot but daily obſerve in all other Caſes.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>our Caſe</hi> now is quite otherwiſe; <hi>our Prejudices</hi> and <hi>our Intereſt</hi> are both <hi>for Chriſtianity;</hi> for we ſuck'd it in with our Mothers Milk, and we found it the eſtabliſh'd Religion of the Country where we were Born; for which Reaſons we believed it, or at leaſt were ſtrongly inclined to believe it, before we knew or had beard of any other Reaſons; ſo that to <hi>us,</hi> who are already <hi>inclined</hi> on this ſide; to <hi>us,</hi> who to be ſure, are <hi>not prejudiced</hi> againſt it; to <hi>us,</hi> whoſe <hi>Intereſt</hi> leads us to <hi>continue</hi> in the Religion we were firſt bred in, <hi>ſuch Proof</hi> as we always accept and allow of in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Caſes of the like Nature, is Proof <hi>ſtrong enough.</hi> And therefore much rather when we have, as indeed we have, a ſtronger and more uncontrouled Tradition for the Truth of the <hi>Goſpel-Hiſtory,</hi> that of any Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory in the World beſides, we ſhall be inconſiſtent with our ſelves, if we do not allow it to be ſufficient.</p>
                  <p>So that upon the whole Matter, conſidering the <hi>Prejudices</hi> both from <hi>Education</hi> and <hi>Intereſt</hi> which <hi>they</hi> lay under who lived in thoſe Times when the Goſpel was firſt reveal'd and preach'd; even <hi>their own Eye-ſight</hi> of <hi>ſome</hi> of thoſe Miracles that were then wrought to confirm it, was not <hi>more perſwaſive</hi>
                     <pb n="20" facs="tcp:52663:112"/> than is that <hi>good Aſſurance</hi> that we now have by credible and undoubted <hi>Records</hi> that ſuch Miracles were then wrought. The Proof they had, conſider'd in it ſelf, was indeed ſtronger than ours; but conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering our different Circumſtances, that Proof was not more apt or likely to convince them, than that which we have given us is to convince and perſuade us. And if we had now the very ſame Proof and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration of the Miracles wrought for the Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of our Chriſtian Religion, <hi>viz.</hi> The Evidence of our own Senſes; this, which was but ſufficient to them, might to us be ſuch a Proof as would be, in a manner, a <hi>Force</hi> upon us; ſuch clear Demonſtration meeting with no ſtrong Prejudice or conſiderable In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt on the other ſide, might be enough to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>power us, ſo that we could not be <hi>Infidels</hi> if we would, and then there would be no Virtue in Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The <hi>Unreaſonableneſs</hi> of <hi>deſiring more Proof</hi> of the Truth of Religion than God has been pleaſed to afford us by the <hi>Standing Revelation</hi> of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> and particularly of deſiring that God would be pleas'd to work new Miracles for our particular ſatisfaction, or for the Conviction of ſome of our Friends that are not perſuaded by the Goſpel-Revelation, will fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther appear, if we conſider the <hi>equal Right</hi> that <hi>all other</hi> Men have to deſire the ſame, and the many <hi>Inconveniencies</hi> and <hi>Abſurdities</hi> that would follow, in caſe <hi>all Men</hi> ſhould be gratified in this Deſire.</p>
                  <p>For as to the <hi>firſt</hi> of theſe, <hi>viz.</hi> The <hi>equal Right</hi> that <hi>all other</hi> Men have to deſire the ſame; What Reaſon can <hi>I</hi> pretend for <hi>my</hi> Infidelity, which <hi>ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Man</hi> my not alſo as well plead for <hi>his?</hi> Have not
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:52663:112"/> 
                     <hi>I</hi> as good Proof of the Truth of Religion as <hi>my Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour</hi> has? Have not I as free Recourſe to the Holy Scriptures as <hi>he?</hi> and the ſame Evidence of the Truth and Divine Inſpiration of them that <hi>he</hi> has? And are we not alſo in all other Reſpects <hi>alike?</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Born in the <hi>ſame</hi> Country, and having had the <hi>ſame</hi> Education, and conſequently being probable to have the <hi>ſame</hi> Inclinations towards, or the <hi>ſame</hi> Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices againſt, or Averſion to the Chriſtian Faith? And if ſo, what Reaſon can I plead for any extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary or peculiar Favour? For is not <hi>he</hi> God's Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture as well as <hi>I?</hi> And hath not God the ſame Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs and Regard for <hi>him</hi> that he hath for <hi>me,</hi> and conſequently the ſame Deſire of <hi>his</hi> Welfare, that I can ſuppoſe he hath of <hi>mine?</hi> Why then ſhould not God grant <hi>him</hi> this ſame Requeſt whether in the Behalf of himſelf or his Friend, as well as <hi>I</hi> can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect he ſhould grant it <hi>me?</hi> In a word, Why may not <hi>every Man</hi> deſire the ſame as well as <hi>I?</hi> And why ſhould not God grant it to <hi>all</hi> that deſire it, as well as to <hi>any one?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But now if God ſhould do this, ſee what <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniencies</hi> and <hi>Abſurdities</hi> would follow there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon?</p>
                  <p>One ſort of Men would not believe, unleſs they <hi>might ſee Apparitions; If one went unto them from the dead, they would repent.</hi> And ſo for their ſakes the World muſt be filled with <hi>Ghoſts;</hi> the Dead muſt never be at Reſt in their Graves, and the Souls in Bliſs who once rejoyced in the thought of being for ever got clear out of a troubleſome World, muſt be content (to gratifie theſe Men) to leave their Place in <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>'s Boſome, and to be deprived of the Beatifical
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:52663:113"/> Viſion, and the unſpeakable Joys of Heaven, as long and as often as any of theſe unreaſonable Men are pleaſed to deſire it.</p>
                  <p>But another ſort of Men it may be there are, that would not like this kind of Proof; A <hi>tranſient</hi> Appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rition of a Ghoſt they'd look upon perhaps as a thing too liable to Cheat and Impoſture; they'd therefore deſire ſome more <hi>plain</hi> and <hi>ſenſible</hi> and <hi>permanent</hi> Miracles than this; ſome ſuch Miracles as thoſe were which our <hi>Saviour</hi> and his <hi>Apoſtles</hi> wrought; and if they could but ſee <hi>ſuch,</hi> they make no doubt but they ſhould be convinced: And ſo for their ſakes, and for their Conviction, half the Men that are born into the World, muſt be born Lame or Blind, that ſo they may be afterwards Cured by Miracle, for the ſatisfaction of theſe Men: And a great many muſt be poſſeſſed with Devils, and be grievouſly torn and tortured by them, that theſe Men may have the Pleaſure of ſeeing with their own Eyes the Evil Spirits caſt forth; and of obſerving how much more calm and ſober the Men are after the Devil is gone out, than they were before.</p>
                  <p>But even theſe Miracles, 'tis like, would not ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie all; but ſome it may be, would be apt to ſuſpect that there might be ſome Trick or Colluſion in them, and that what they ſaw, was done only by a <hi>Confederacy</hi> between the <hi>Phyſician</hi> and the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient,</hi> to amuſe and deceive the Beholders; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, what they, it may be, would deſire for their particular ſatisfaction, wou'd be, to ſee a dead Man raiſed to Life again after he had been dead ſeveral Days, and began to ſtink; and ſuch a Miracle as this they are ſure would convince them. And ſo
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:52663:113"/> for their ſakes a great many Men muſt die two or three times over, or much oftner; becauſe perhaps every time before they have been dead a Week, ſome other Perſon that was not preſent before, may have a deſire to ſee with his own Eyes the ſame Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment tried over again.</p>
                  <p>But even this Miracle alſo would perhaps be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted againſt by ſome, and nothing leſs would ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie them than the very <hi>ſame</hi> Evidence which the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> themſelves had, who converſed with our <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour</hi> for ſome years together, and <hi>heard</hi> all his wiſe <hi>Diſcourſes,</hi> and <hi>ſaw</hi> all his <hi>Miracles</hi> and mighty Works, and were <hi>preſent</hi> with him when he expired on the Croſs, and <hi>aſſiſted</hi> at the laying his dead Body into the Sepulchre, and within three Days after <hi>ſaw</hi> him alive again, <hi>touched</hi> and <hi>handled</hi> him, <hi>eat</hi> and <hi>drank</hi> with him; and after they had thus, ſeveral times, by the Space of forty Days, been, by <hi>many Infallible Proofs,</hi> aſſured of the Reality of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, <hi>ſaw</hi> him viſibly taken up in his Body into Heaven.</p>
                  <p>They that had this, they grant, had very good Proof and Evidence of the Truth of the Chriſtian Religion; and had they but been of this happy Number, they are ſure they ſhould not only have believed, but alſo willingly have ſuffered as much as the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> themſelves did for Bearing their Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to the Truth of thoſe things which they had ſeen and heard.</p>
                  <p>And what now muſt be done for the Satisfaction of theſe Men? For <hi>theſe</hi> have as <hi>much Right</hi> to a full Satisfaction as any <hi>others;</hi> and by the ſame <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi>
                     <pb n="24" facs="tcp:52663:114"/> that <hi>others</hi> do expect to be gratified in what they deſire, <hi>theſe</hi> may do ſo too.</p>
                  <p>And therefore in order to their Satisfaction, it is neceſſary that our <hi>Saviour</hi> ſhould be Born into the World in every <hi>Age</hi> of it, or indeed much oftner; and that in every <hi>Country</hi> at leaſt, if not in every <hi>Town</hi> and <hi>Village</hi> he ſhould <hi>live</hi> and <hi>Preach</hi> and <hi>do Miracles,</hi> and be <hi>Crucified</hi> and <hi>Riſe again;</hi> for that theſe things have been once done, they can't, they ſay, believe only upon the <hi>Teſtimony</hi> of other Men who ſay they did ſee them; And therefore by the ſame Reaſon, if they themſelves ſhould ſee them, other Men that ſhould come after, or live in other Countries, would have as little Cauſe to believe their Teſtimony.</p>
                  <p>So that for the full ſatisfaction of all ſuch Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Men as theſe our <hi>Saviour</hi> muſt have ſuffered <hi>often</hi> ſince the Beginning of the World, and muſt continue to do ſo very <hi>frequently</hi> as long as the World ſhall laſt, becauſe with ſome Men, nothing but ſeeing is Believing.</p>
                  <p>But that this ſhould be, is what I preſume none beſides themſelves can think it <hi>reaſonable</hi> either for <hi>Men</hi> to <hi>ask,</hi> or for <hi>God</hi> to <hi>grant.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. Laſtly, The <hi>Unreaſonableneſs</hi> of <hi>deſiring</hi> any <hi>further</hi> or <hi>additional Proof</hi> of the Truth of Religion, beſides what is already afforded us in the <hi>Standing Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of the <hi>Holy Scripture,</hi> will farther appear by conſidering our <hi>own Intereſt</hi> in being convinced and perſuaded of the Truth of Religion by ſuch Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Motives as are in themſelves <hi>ſufficient</hi> for that purpoſe, altho' they be not ſo very ſtrong and forcible as we could wiſh they were.</p>
                  <pb n="25" facs="tcp:52663:114"/>
                  <p>And this Argument I ſhall handle in the way of <hi>Reproof,</hi> (and a juſt and ſeaſonable Reproof I think it) to ſuch bold and preſuming Perſons as I have been now ſpeaking of, who will needs ſtand upon their Terms with Almighty God, and will not be perſuaded to Believe and Repent, but juſt by ſuch Reaſons and ſuch Motives as they themſelves ſhall be pleaſed to require.

                  <p>Very well; Then I ſay you may, if you will, continue ſtill in your Unbelief and Impenitence; Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs I would adviſe you, before you fully de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine to perſiſt in this Reſolution, to take a little time to conſider ſeriouſly, <hi>whoſe Intereſt</hi> and <hi>Concern</hi> it is, either that you ſhould Believe, or that you ſhould not Believe; conſider <hi>who</hi> it is that will be a <hi>Gainer</hi> or a <hi>Sufferer,</hi> either by the <hi>One,</hi> or by the <hi>Other.</hi> For let me tell you, if there be really a Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and a Hell, and a Judgment, and a Life to come, 'tis not your not believing them that will make them not to be; and if theſe things are true, 'tis your <hi>own Life</hi> and <hi>Soul</hi> that is at Stake; and if you are reſolv'd to loſe both unleſs you may be Saved <hi>your own way,</hi> you your ſelves will be the greateſt, nay you your <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>But now on the other ſide, if the Story which he tells me be true, and it be for <hi>my Intereſt</hi> and <hi>Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage</hi> only, <hi>not</hi> at all for <hi>his</hi> that I ſhould believe it to be true; If, I ſay, <hi>he</hi> will be neither a <hi>Gainer</hi> nor a <hi>Loſer,</hi> whether I believe his Report, or whether I do not believe it; then, if he gives me ſuch Evidence of the Truth of it, as is <hi>ſufficient</hi> to convince a <hi>Man</hi> of <hi>Reaſon,</hi> he has done <hi>enough;</hi> he has done all that belonged to him as a Friend to do. And if after this, I make it my Buſineſs to <hi>cavil</hi> at and to <hi>except</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his Evidence, and go about to <hi>preſcribe</hi> to him what ſort of Proof he ſhould give me of the Truth of what he relates; declaring withal that leſs or other Proof than juſt that which I require ſhall never
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:52663:115"/> ſatisfie me; he may juſtly reject my Suit as unreaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, and condemn me for a Fool, that will not ſee <hi>my own Intereſt,</hi> nor know when a Friend has done enough.</p>
                  <p>And this is exactly our Caſe.</p>
                  <p>God has ſent his Son to us with the Promiſe of Eternal Life, and has given us <hi>ſufficient Aſſurance</hi> of his Divine Miſſion, and thereby of the Truth of that Revelation which he made. Now if we will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve this, well, and good, the <hi>Profit</hi> will be all <hi>our own;</hi> we ſhall ſave our <hi>own</hi> Souls alive; But God will receive no Advantage to himſelf by our Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving; his perfect Happineſs being not capable of any Increaſe. But if we will not Believe this Teſtimony that God has given of his Son, if we except againſt his Witneſſes, and cavil at his Evidence, and will not Believe but juſt upon that very ſort of Proof which we our ſelves are pleas'd to pitch upon; why then, we may e'en take our own Courſe, we may be Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believers ſtill; but 'tis <hi>we</hi> only that ſhall ſuffer by our Unbelief; the Infinite and Eſſential Happineſs of God, being as little capable of Diminution, as of Advancement. And, as if we Believe and Repent, God will be Glorified in our Salvation, ſo, if we will not Believe and Repent, he will be no leſs glorified in our Deſtruction.</p>
                  <p>Seeing therefore whether you Believe or whether you do not Believe, God will be neither a Gainer nor a Loſer; but the <hi>Profit</hi> or the <hi>Damage</hi> will be <hi>all</hi> your <hi>own;</hi> it is plainly your <hi>Intereſt</hi> as well as your <hi>Duty</hi> to give Credit to ſuch Evidence, as really and in it ſelf is Credible (and ſuch, I hope I have already ſhewn that to be which is given us of the Truth of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity)
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:52663:116"/> and not to ſet your ſelves to cavil at it, and to ſtudy Exceptions to it; not to take upon you to preſcribe to God Almighty, and boldly to tell him what ſort of Evidence he muſt give you, or elſe you will not be ſatisfied.</p>
                  <p>Do not then ſtand in your own Light; do not bring Deſtruction upon your ſelves when you may avoid it; but give Ear to what <hi>Moſes</hi> and the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets</hi> and <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his <hi>Apoſtles</hi> ſpeak to you in the <hi>Holy Scriptures;</hi> and hear them without Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice, with a Mind ready to hearken to Reaſon, and reſolved to be perſuaded by it; and then what they will ſay to you will be abundantly <hi>ſufficient</hi> to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie you; for they ſay as much in this Caſe (or more) as by the common Voice and Reaſon of all Mankind is judged to be ſufficient in all other Caſes of the like Nature.</p>
                  <p>But if you are reſolved not to be perſuaded ſo long as there is any Poſſibility of Doubt or Scruple left; if you are reſolv'd not to Believe unleſs you may have juſt that very Evidence given you that you your ſelves are pleas'd to require; if you will boldly and arrogantly take upon you to teach God, (as if he knew it not) what Evidence he ought to give Men of the Truth of Religion; and are reſolved to find or make Exceptions againſt any other; Look you to it; For if God has done enough already, he is under no manner of Obligation to do more; more, did I ſay? Nay he needed not to have done ſo much; for it was meer Grace and Favour in God that he has done ſo much as he has done; that he has made us any Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes at all, and given us any Aſſurance of the Truth of them. And therefore for what he has done we
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:52663:116"/> ought to be thankful, and not to find fault with him that he has done no more. Such Impudence and Sau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cineſs as this (for I can call it by no better a Name) from a <hi>Man</hi> to his <hi>Maker,</hi> from a <hi>mean inconſiderable Creature,</hi> to the <hi>Great Lord</hi> of <hi>Heaven</hi> and <hi>Earth,</hi> is I'm ſure no proper Qualification to merit extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary and peculiar Favours. For as our <hi>Saviour</hi> ſays to ſome in a like Caſe, to ſome who formerly made the like unreaſonable Demand that you now do,<note place="margin">Matth. 12.39. Mark 8.12.</note> It is <hi>an Evil and Adulterous Generation</hi> that <hi>ſeeketh after a Sign, and</hi> therefore <hi>there ſhall no Sign be given— Verily I ſay unto you, there ſhall no Sign be given to this Generation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Let us then be <hi>content</hi> with that aſſurance which God has given us of the Truth of Religion; for greater than this we ſhall not have 'till it be too late. Let us <hi>thankfully accept of,</hi> and <hi>readily comply</hi> with this, and not expect or wait for more; for God will not gratifie us in our unreaſonable Deſire. He is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to deal with us as with Men, to incline, not to determine our Choice; to perſuade, not to force us to be Happy. And having already given us the <hi>Standing Revelation</hi> of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> which is <hi>ſufficient</hi> both to inſtruct and convince us, and having prov'd the truth of this <hi>ſufficiently</hi> to us, he will not be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king new Revelations, or ſending more Prophets Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinely inſpir'd, or working freſh Miracles every Day. He has done enough already to ſatisfie our ſober Judgments; and he will not do every thing that we can think of to gratifie our wild and extravagant Fancies.</p>
                  <p>And there is the leſs Reaſon that he ſhould do ſo, becauſe if the Ordinary Means which he uſes for our
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:52663:117"/> Converſion do not ſucceed, the Fault lies wholly in us; And therefore 'tis highly probable (ſo certain that it need not be tried) that any other means proper for God to uſe to reclaim us, would be alike unſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful. <hi>If they hear not Moſes and the Prophets, neither will they be perſuaded tho' one roſe from the Dead.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is the <hi>laſt Reply</hi> that <hi>Abraham</hi> makes to the <hi>Rich Man</hi>'s Requeſt; and it was the third of thoſe three Points which I at firſt propounded to ſpeak to; but which I muſt reſerve for the Subject of my next Diſcourſe.</p>

                     <p>Abraham ſaith unto him, They have Moſes and the Prophets; let them hear them.</p>
                     <p>And he ſaid, Nay, father Abraham: but if one went unto them from the dead, they will repent.</p>
                     <p>And he ſaid unto him, If they hear not Moſes and the Prophets, neither will they be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded, though one roſe from the dead.</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>IN Diſcourſing on theſe Words, I have already done theſe two Things.</p>
                  <p n="1">I. I have ſhewn that the preſent <hi>Standing Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation</hi> of God's Will in the <hi>Holy Scripture</hi> is abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly <hi>ſufficient</hi> to perſuade Men to Repentance, if they are not unreaſonably blind and obſtinate. This is intimated in the firſt Verſe of the Text; <hi>They have Moſes and the Prophets; (Chriſt</hi> and <hi>his Apoſtles) let them hear them.</hi> And,</p>
                  <p n="2">II. I have likewiſe ſhewn, that having already ſuch good Grounds of Faith, ſuch full Directions for Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, and ſuch ſtrong Motives to Repentance, it is <hi>unreaſonable</hi> to deſire more. This was what the <hi>Rich Man</hi> had done at the 27th. and 28th. Verſes; and which he ſtill continues to do in the 2d Verſe of the Text, even after <hi>Abraham</hi> had told him that the
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:52663:119"/> 
                     <hi>Standing Revelation</hi> of God's Will in the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture was <hi>ſufficient; Nay, Father Abraham, but if one went unto them from the dead, they will repent.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He ſays it poſitively, <hi>they will repent;</hi> He ſpeaks it as a thing that no Doubt could be made of. In An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to which therefore <hi>Abraham</hi> tells him in the laſt Verſe of the Text, that that which he thought ſo very certain, was not ſo much as probable: <hi>If they hear not Moſes and the Prophets, neither will they be perſuaded tho' one roſe from the dead.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And this was the third Point I propounded to ſpeak to in diſcourſing on theſe Words; <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">III. To ſhew, that in Caſe God ſhould condeſcend to gratifie Men in this unreaſonable Deſire, (working every Day new Miracles before their Eyes, or ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their deceaſed Friends to them from the Dead, to aſſure them of a Future State, and to warn them to prepare for it) 'tis highly probable that very <hi>few</hi> or <hi>none</hi> of thoſe who do not believe, and are not brought to Repentance by the Preaching and Standing Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Goſpel, would be <hi>perſuaded</hi> by <hi>this means. If they hear not Moſes and the Prophets,</hi> (I add, nor <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his <hi>Apoſtles) neither will they be perſuaded tho' one roſe from the dead.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And the Truth of this will, I ſuppoſe, ſufficiently appear if theſe following things be conſidered. 1. That we can't have <hi>better</hi> or <hi>ſtronger Motives</hi> to Obedience and a Holy Life than are already offered in the <hi>Holy Scripture</hi> to perſuade us. 2. That the <hi>Proof</hi> and <hi>Evidence</hi> already given us of the Truth of Religion is ſuch as cannot be <hi>fairly</hi> excepted againſt, and that there is no Proof thereof that could be
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:52663:119"/> offered, but what is liable to <hi>Cavils</hi> and <hi>unreaſonable Exceptions.</hi> 3. That if God ſhould gratifie all Men in this Requeſt, the <hi>Abundance</hi> and <hi>Commonneſs</hi> of the Miracles that muſt then be wrought would go near to <hi>deſtroy</hi> the Efficacy and Perſuaſiveneſs thereof. And, Laſtly, That it is <hi>Matter</hi> of <hi>Fact,</hi> and <hi>Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience</hi> that new Miracles have been generally unſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful upon thoſe who have not hearkned to nor been convinced by a <hi>Standing Revelation</hi> of God's Will.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. I ſay, we can't poſſibly have, as to the <hi>Matter</hi> of them, <hi>ſtronger Motives</hi> to Obedience and a Holy Life, than thoſe which are already offered in the <hi>Holy Scripture</hi> to perſuade us. For there we have <hi>Life and Death ſet before us, Bleſſing and Curſing;</hi> on one Hand, <hi>the Promiſe of this Life and of that which is to come;</hi> and on the other Hand all the Evils that we can juſtly dread, the wrath of him who is a <hi>conſuming Fire;</hi> who often puniſhes Tranſgreſſors with remarkable Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in this Life, and has threatned to all impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Sinners Eternal Torments in the next.</p>
                  <p>Now if a new Revelation was to be made, and we our ſelves were to contrive the <hi>Matter</hi> of it, what ſtronger Motives than theſe could we think of? Or if one ſhould come from the dead to Preach to us, if <hi>Lazarus</hi> were ſent on purpoſe to perſuade us, what could he offer more towards it? Could he give us Aſſurance of any thing better or more deſirable than of God's Readineſs to forgive us upon our Repentance, and of compleat and perfect Happineſs both of Body and Soul to all Eternity if we do Repent? Or could he threaten any thing more like to deter us from Sin than intolerable and everlaſting Miſery? If not, to
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:52663:120"/> what Purpoſe ſhould he be ſent to us? Or indeed to what Purpoſe ſhould there be any <hi>new Revelation</hi> at all? For theſe things are already promiſed and threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned clearly enough in the <hi>Holy Scripture; Life and Immortality are</hi> already fully <hi>brought to Light by the Goſpel;</hi> And if the Hope of Eternal Life and Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and if the Dread of Everlaſting and Intolerable Torments will not perſuade us, nothing certainly will or can perſuade us.</p>
                  <p>All that, I think, could in any new Revela<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>on be added to that Encouragement that is already given us in Scripture to Virtue and Godlineſs, or to that Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement that is therein given as to Vice and Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs, would be an Aſſurance that there ſhould be always as remarkable a <hi>Difference</hi> made, by the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> between good and bad Men, in <hi>this World,</hi> as we are told in Scripture there will be, by his <hi>righteous Judgment,</hi> in <hi>that</hi> which is to <hi>come.</hi> And a good Aſſurance given us of this by ſome new Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, confirmed by our own conſtant Obſervation that it was always well with the Righteous and ill with the Wicked in this World, we may think per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps would do much more towards the Reformation of Mankind, than only thoſe Promiſes and Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of future Happineſs or Miſery that we meet with in the Scripture have done, or are ever like to do.</p>
                  <p>And this indeed might be. But then 'tis to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered that a new Revelation to this Effect would be inconſiſtent with the Nature of Religion, and would fruſtrate the Deſign of God in ſending us into this World, which was to prove and try us, to ſee whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we love the Lord with all our Heart; whether
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:52663:120"/> we can believe him for thoſe things which we do not ſee; and whether we are ſo wiſe as to prefer a greater future Good before a leſs that is preſent, a Bleſſed and Glorious Immortality after this Life, before the Pleaſures of Sin which are but for a Seaſon. For if the Reward of Virtue and the Puniſhment of Vice were always viſible and preſent, there would be no Room left for Faith in God, which is a firm Belief of the Truth of his Promiſes and Threatnings, tho' we do not ſee a preſent Performance of them;<note place="margin">Heb. 11.1.</note> 
                     <hi>Faith</hi> (as the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> defines it) <hi>is the Subſtance,</hi> or<note n="(a)" place="margin">

                        </gap>.</note> Conviction <hi>of things not ſeen.</hi> And if all the good things both of this Life and of the next were the certain Portion of Virtue, and all the evil things that can be ſuffered both in this World and in the other were the certain and never-failing Conſequence of Sin, there would be no room left for a virtuous and wiſe Choice; nay indeed there would be hardly Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for Choice at all; for it can't be conceiv'd that a Creature that has Underſtanding and a Power of chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and refuſing, ſhould knowingly chuſe all Miſery rather than all Happineſs. Such a Revelation as this being therefore ſo evidently inconſiſtent with the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Faith and Religion, and with the Deſign of God in ſending us into this World, can't be expected. And I ſay that, bating this, there can be nothing ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the <hi>Matter</hi> of the Scripture Revelation. From whence therefore it plainly follows, that ſuch as are not perſuaded by the Goſpel Motives to Repentance, are not capable of being perſuaded by any ſuch Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives as, conſiſtently with the Nature of Faith and Religion and Vertue, could be offered to them; And
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:52663:121"/> it can't be ſuppoſed that any true divine Revelation ſhould ever offer any Motives to perſuade us that are not ſuch.</p>
                  <p>But it may be ſaid perhaps, that tho' better or ſtronger Motives to Repentance cannot be offered by any new Revelation, than are offered already in Holy Scripture, yet we might by a new Revelation, have <hi>better Aſſurance</hi> given us of the Truth of the Goſpel Motives; and that if we had, 'tis very like they would be then more prevailing than they now are.</p>
                  <p>And this likewiſe I believe muſt be granted. But then 'tis to be conſidered, that the Nature of Faith and Religion, and of that State of Trial which we are now in, requires that there ſhould be a reaſonable Boundary ſet to the clearneſs of that Evidence that is given to Men of the Truth of thoſe Motives whereby they are to be perſuaded, as well as to the Force and Strength of the Motives themſelves; Becauſe (as I noted in my laſt Diſcourſe) ſuch very clear and ſtrong Evidence of the Truth of Religion as leaves no Room for a poſſibility of Doubting, would deſtroy our Freedom of Choice, and, with it, the Virtue and Excellency of Believing; for 'tis not Faith to believe what we ſee and feel; and 'tis no Commendation to a Man to be good and Virtuous, if his Virtue be not the Fruit of a wiſe Judgment and a free Choice; which it would not be if his Judgment was over born by ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refragable Demonſtration. And if that farther Proof and Evidence that is deſired of the Truth of Religion, be no other than ſuch as will leave us a Freedom of Choice and a Poſſibility of Doubting, then I ſay 'tis not likely it ſhould be more convincing to us than that which we have already in the Standing Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:52663:121"/> of Holy Scripture. For it may be conſidered further in the ſecond Place.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That the <hi>Proof</hi> and <hi>Evidence</hi> already given us of the Truth of Religion is ſuch as cannot <hi>fairly</hi> be <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted againſt;</hi> and that there is no <hi>Proof</hi> thereof that could be given us, (unleſs it be ſuch as is not reſiſtible, and conſequently ſuch as is not fit for God to give us, while we are here in a State of Trial) but what is <hi>liable</hi> to <hi>fooliſh Cavils</hi> and <hi>unreaſonable Exceptions;</hi> ſo that conſequently the ſame <hi>Temper</hi> and <hi>Diſpoſition</hi> of Mind, and the ſame <hi>unwillingneſs</hi> to believe which now diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes Men to <hi>Infidelity,</hi> and prompts them to make Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions to the preſent Grounds of the Chriſtian Faith, would work the ſame Effect in caſe other Proof and Evidence were given of the Truth of it.</p>
                  <p>I ſay, <hi>firſt,</hi> That the <hi>Proof</hi> and <hi>Evidence</hi> already gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven us of the Truth of the Chriſtian Religion is ſuch as cannot <hi>fairly</hi> be <hi>excepted againſt.</hi>
                  </p>

Nay if they who make theſe Exceptions in the Caſe of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion did themſelves think that they were juſt and reaſonable, they ought to make the ſame in all other Caſes, that are equally liable to the ſame Exceptions; and in all other ſuch Caſes they ought to live and act as if they had the ſame Doubts and Scruples upon them, which they ſay they have in the Caſe of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; But we ſee the quite contrary every Day we live.</p>
                  <pb n="40" facs="tcp:52663:122"/>
                  <p>For that ſame <hi>Infidel</hi> who will not allow of the <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony</hi> which was given to our <hi>Saviour</hi> by his <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles,</hi> tho' they gave the beſt Aſſurance that it was poſſible for Men to give both of their Knowledge of what they teſtified, and of their Honeſty in relating it, yet readily allows that in all other Caſes the <hi>Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony</hi> of <hi>two</hi> or <hi>three</hi> Credible Perſons ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, without any collateral Evidence of the Truth of their Teſtimony; and thinks it reaſonable that all Diſputes and Controverſies among Men concerning their Civil Rights, their Eſtates, nay and their Lives too, ſhould be thereby determined. And <hi>he</hi> that queſtions whether the <hi>Books</hi> of the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> were <hi>written</hi> by the <hi>reputed Authors,</hi> yet makes no Queſtion but that <hi>other Books,</hi> of as ancient or older Date, and of the Authority of which there is not half ſo much Traditional Evidence, were written by thoſe <hi>Perſons</hi> to whom they are <hi>aſcribed;</hi> and he would think thoſe very unreaſonable Men, who, when he was arguing any Point of Learning with them upon the Authority of <hi>Virgil,</hi> or <hi>Cicero,</hi> or <hi>Seneca,</hi> ſhould refuſe to admit his Argument till he had firſt undeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably and demonſtratively proved that the <hi>Aeneids</hi> were written by <hi>Virgil,</hi> or that the other Pieces that have been allowed in all Ages ever ſince to have been written by <hi>Cicero</hi> or <hi>Seneca,</hi> were not falſly Fathered upon thoſe Authors.

                     </gap>t Evidence that there is of the Truth of this. And he that pretends to be uncertain whether there ever was
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:52663:122"/> ſuch a Man as <hi>Jeſus</hi> of <hi>Nazareth,</hi> and whether he ſaid and did the things Recorded of him by the <hi>Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts,</hi> and whether by the Preaching of his <hi>Apoſtles</hi> he did ſpread his Spiritual Empire over all the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries of the World; (An Empire which is ſtill kept up in moſt of the Countries over which it was firſt extended, and of which there are evident <hi>Marks</hi> and <hi>Memorials</hi> ſtill remaining even in thoſe Countries that have ſince revolted from it;) He, I ſay, that doubts of theſe things altho' witneſſed by the <hi>Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings</hi> of thoſe who were <hi>Eye-Witneſſes</hi> thereof, yet makes no Doubt but that there was ſuch a Man as <hi>Alexander the Great,</hi> who lived above three Hundred years before, and that he tranſlated the Empire of the World from <hi>Perſia</hi> to <hi>Greece;</hi> and he alſo gives full Credit to the other things which he finds related of him, by <hi>Curtius, Plutarch</hi> and <hi>Arrian,</hi> altho' none of theſe Authors were <hi>Eye-Witneſſes</hi> of his Wars and Greatneſs, but either Copied what they wrote from former Hiſtories, or took it up from Report; and altho' there are perhaps no <hi>Remains</hi> of that Empire now left in the World. And if he was but as ſure of a good Eſtate, as that the Hiſtory of <hi>Alexander</hi>'s Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition and Conqueſts is in the main a true Hiſtory, he would not, I believe, give the Hundreth Part of its Value to aſcertain his Title to it.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe therefore are manifeſtly unreaſonable Excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to the Proofs of Chriſtianity which no Man will allow, which even thoſe that make them in this Caſe do not think reaſonable to make, in other Caſes of the like Nature; ſo that it is not at all likely that any Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that is not convinced by theſe Proofs, ſhould be convinced if more were given.</p>
                  <pb n="42" facs="tcp:52663:123"/>
                  <p>For (as I farther noted) there is no <hi>Proof</hi> that could be given us of the Truth of the Chriſtian Religion, (unleſs it be ſuch as is not reſiſtible, and conſequently not fit for God to give us, while we are here in a State of Trial) but what is <hi>liable</hi> to <hi>fooliſh Cavils</hi> and <hi>unreaſonable Exceptions.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This I think is ſo ſelf-Evident, that nothing plainer or more undeniable can be ſaid to prove it. For tho' the Demonſtration of the Truth of Religion were as plain as Demonſtrations in the <hi>Mathematicks,</hi> yet even theſe may be cavil'd at by ſuch as will allow of no <hi>Poſtulata</hi>'s, nor grant the Truth of the cleareſt <hi>Axioms.</hi> Nay there have been <hi>Scepticks</hi> in the plaineſt <hi>Matters</hi> of <hi>Senſe,</hi> and ſome have denied <hi>Motion</hi> at the ſame time that their own Tongues were <hi>moving</hi> to deny it.</p>
                  <p>Not that I think the Demonſtration of the Truth of Religion is as clear as any Propoſtion in <hi>Euclid,</hi> or as the ſhining of the Sun at Noon, (for that can't be, and I have already given Reaſons why, if it might, it ſhould not be ſo) but it is as clear as ſuch a Matter is capable to be. And I dare be bold to ſay that there is no other Proof of Religion fit to be offered, or reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably to be deſired, to which a <hi>Sceptick</hi> might not make as juſt and plauſible Exceptions as he can to the Standing Proofs of Chriſtianity. For <hi>one ſingle Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle</hi> done in his own Preſence would be nothing near ſo convincing as the <hi>many Miracles</hi> wrought by <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his <hi>Apoſtles</hi> were, of ſome or other of which there were more than ten thouſand Witneſſes; and if he can ſuppoſe that ſo many were deceived in plain Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Senſe, he may much rather ſuppoſe that he, a ſingle Man, may be impoſed upon. And an <hi>Appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rition</hi>
                     <pb n="43" facs="tcp:52663:123"/> of a deceaſed Friend would be a Matter wherein any one Man might be more probably Cheated, or be more eaſiy perſuaded that he was Cheated, than the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> could be in the <hi>Reſurrection</hi> of our <hi>Lord,</hi> when he was ſeen by them very frequently, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times by a great Company of them met together, by the ſpace of forty Days. And a ſingle <hi>Miracle</hi> that is over as ſoon as done, could not make ſuch a deep and laſting Impreſſion upon a Man's Mind, as that <hi>conſtant Power</hi> of working Miracles, and eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally the <hi>Gift</hi> of <hi>Tongues,</hi> which laſted a whole Life, muſt needs do upon the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> and thoſe that lived in their time, who were either Partakers of theſe Gifts themſelves, or conſtant Witneſſes thereof in others.</p>
                  <p>In ſhort, whatever Miracles we can deſire may be wrought for our Conviction, either they muſt be <hi>ſeen</hi> by us with our <hi>own Eyes,</hi> or elſe they muſt be receiv'd by <hi>Teſtimony</hi> from others.</p>
                  <p>And tho' they ſhould be <hi>ſeen</hi> by us with our <hi>own Eyes,</hi> yet ſo long as 'tis againſt our Inclination, or inconſiſtent with that Love which we bear to the World or to our Sins, to believe that they are true Miracles, we ſhould eaſily be apt to fanſie that they were only <hi>melancholy Deluſions,</hi> or <hi>Tricks</hi> put upon us by Deſigning Men, which our firſt Fright or Amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment hindred us from diſcovering the fraud of; and ſo they would probably have no effect at all upon us longer than till our Fright or Amazement was well worn off.</p>
                  <p>But if we ſhould only have an Account of them by <hi>Teſtimony</hi> from others, they would be yet leſs likely to perſuade us; becauſe there can be no Teſtimony
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:52663:124"/> concerning any ſuch Matters of Fact more clear and unexceptionable than that which we have already of the Truth of our Saviour's and his Apoſtles Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles; ſo that if we believe not this, we ſhould hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier believe any other Teſtimony, becauſe we can ſcarcely have ſo good Aſſurance of any Man's Truth as we have of the Sincerity and Veracity of all thoſe who are the preſent Witneſſes to our Religion; and we can hardly be ſurer that we hear any Man whom we know, ſpeaking to us, than we are that we hear the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> ſpeaking to us in the <hi>Books</hi> of the <hi>New Teſtament.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And therefore I think it plainly follows (as I far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther noted) that the ſame <hi>Temper</hi> and <hi>Diſpoſition</hi> of <hi>Mind,</hi> and the ſame <hi>Unwillingneſs</hi> to believe the Truths of the Goſpel, which now diſpoſe Men to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelity, and prompt them to ſtudy and make Excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to the Proofs already given us of the Chriſtian Faith, would work the ſame Effect if other Proof and Evidence were given of it, and that Men would then quickly make as good Exceptions to that, as they do now to theſe. For from what has been ſaid, I think 'tis plain that if Men do not ſee the Truth when 'tis placed in ſo clear a Light as 'tis in already, the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon muſt be becauſe they wilfully ſhut their Eyes, or elſe are ſo blinded by a Love of this World, or of their ſinful Luſts, that if the Light were ten times brighter than it is, they would ſee no more than they do now. And it would be to as little Purpoſe, in order to the Conviction of ſuch perverſe and obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Men, to add an more or ſtronger Proofs of the Truth of Religion, as it would be to light up abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of Torches to a Man that is quite blind.</p>
                  <pb n="45" facs="tcp:52663:124"/>
                  <p>For this is indeed the true Cauſe why Men will not hear <hi>Moſes</hi> and the <hi>Prophets,</hi> why they will not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> teſtifying the certainty of a future State and other Truths of Religion; 'tis not, I ſay, becauſe there is any juſt Exception to their Teſtimony, but becauſe they do not like the Matter of it, and ſo are reſolved not to believe. They love their Sins ſo well that they can upon no Account be perſuaded to part with them, and being ſo reſolved, it is an eaſie thing to cavil at any Motives or Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that are urged to perſuade them to it; Seeing they will not ſee, and hearing they will not hear nor underſtand; and to Men ſo obſtinately reſolved a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Conviction, no Proof can be convincing enough.</p>
                  <p>And this is the ſad effect of Love to Sin; it Vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates the Judgments of Men, ſo that they can't diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh between things that differ moſt vaſtly; it dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens their Underſtanding, ſo that the plaineſt Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition or the cleareſt Conſequence in the World, if it be againſt the Intereſt of Sin, ſeems dark and obſcure to them; and it renders their Minds ſo averſe to Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, that they can't with any Patience ſo much as hear the Arguments that are offered to prove it; And be a Reaſon never ſo good, 'tis not to be hoped it ſhould be convincing to a Man who will not hear it, or who will not allow himſelf calmly to conſider it.</p>
                  <p>From all that hath been ſaid therefore upon this Head, it plainly appears, That the proper Cure of Infidelity is not the Addition of more Proof of the Truth of Religion, but a right Prepaartion and Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of Mind to conſider well the Proof thereof that
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:52663:125"/> is offered; which is ſufficient to convince and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade all thoſe that have a Love of Truth, and a Will diſpoſed to Virtue. The Cauſes of Infidelity muſt be firſt removed, and then the Cure of it will be eaſie, by thoſe Means which God has provided and directed us to uſe, and there will be no need of his Working Miracles for Men's Conviction; But 'till the Cauſes of it are removed, 'tis hardly to be Cured even by a Miracle.</p>
                  <p>But it will be ſaid perhaps that tho' freſh Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and new Miracles might not be ſufficient to convince all, they might however convince ſome; becauſe there are ſeveral Degrees in the Perverſeneſs and Obſtinacy of Men; Some indeed there may be whom no ſuch Proof of Religion as is fit to be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven us in this State of Trial would perſuade, whoſe Caſe therefore muſt be given over as deſperate; but then there are others,<note place="margin">Acts 26.28.</note> who (as <hi>King Agrippa</hi> was) are <hi>almoſt perſuaded to be Chriſtians;</hi> and when the Scales are already near even, a ſmall weight put into the lighteſt will make it overbalance the other; ſo that it may reaſonably be hoped that ſome ſmall Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to the Proof of Religion (no more than might be made to it without deſtroying either our Freedom of Choice or the Excellency of Faith and Virtue) would prevail with theſe <hi>Half Chriſtians.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And perhaps it might; But God is wiſer than we are, and knows better than we what is fit for him to do towards the Converſion of Men. We ought therefore to conclude that he does all that is fit to be done, tho' we do not ſee but that he might do more.</p>
                  <p>But this, it may be, will not be taken for an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, but will rather be thought a way of avoiding a
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:52663:125"/> Difficulty too hard to be accounted for. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſay further, (and it was the third thing which I propoſed to be conſidered,)</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That if God ſhould gratifie all Men in this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, working new Miracles every Day for the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction of particular Perſons;<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Sermon</hi> VII.</note> (and, as I have formerly noted, there is no Reaſon in the World, why any one Man ſhould be gratified in this Requeſt rather than others, when they have all equal Reaſon and equal Right to deſire it; ſhould God, I ſay, gratifie all Men in this Requeſt) the <hi>Abundance</hi> of the <hi>Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles</hi> that muſt then be wrought, woud be ſo far from adding to the Proof of Chriſtianity, that if would rather <hi>leſſen</hi> or <hi>weaken</hi> that Proof of it which we have already; becauſe Miracles (the propereſt Proof of a Publick Divine Revelation) would not be then ſo convincing as they are now.</p>
                  <p>For that which moſt of all affects Men in a Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle is the <hi>Unuſualneſs</hi> of it; becauſe it is ſuch a thing as was never or but rarely before ever ſeen or heard of; As the <hi>Blind Man</hi> that had been Cured by our <hi>Saviour</hi> well obſerves, <hi>Joh.</hi> ix. 32. <hi>Since the Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                     </gap>ot have been thought ſo by Men. For that which makes Men wonder even at a true Miracle is not ſo much becauſe it is ſuch an Operation as they cannot <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

                     </gap>f Nature; But they therefore conclude ſuch a thing
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:52663:126"/> not to be a Natural Operation, becauſe it is not uſual, becauſe it is ſuch a thing as was never before known to be done: And if the ſame thing which now, for this Reaſon, we ſhould account a Miracle was done every Day, the <hi>Virtuoſi</hi> would preſently ſet them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to invent, and would quickly fancy they had found out ſome Natural Solution of it; And I believe there are not many Miracles that have been done which they might not after long Study be able to give as clear and probable an Account of by Natural Cauſes, as they have done of <hi>Gravity,</hi> of <hi>Fire,</hi> of the <hi>Loadſtone,</hi> of <hi>Viſion,</hi> of the <hi>Production</hi> of <hi>Vegetables,</hi> of the <hi>Generation</hi> of <hi>Animals,</hi> and of many other things which yet are doubtleſs the Works and Effects of Natural Cauſes.</p>
                  <p>So that I ſay the moſt probable Conſequence of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Miracles ſo very common as they muſt be if they were wrought for the Conviction of particular Men, would be this, that they wou'd ceaſe to ſerve for that Purpoſe for which Miracles were deſigned; becauſe being common they would be diſregarded, or would quickly be looked upon to be the Effect of Natural Cauſes only; There would not be wanting thoſe that would offer to give an Account how they were done; and all thoſe would be deſpiſed by the Scorners of Religion, as too much addicted to Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition; who rather than attribute the greateſt Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle to a Supernatural Power, would not acquieſce in that Solution (how ſilly ſoever) that was given of it by meer <hi>Matter</hi> and <hi>Motion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And in particular, I queſtion not but that if it was a common thing for dead Men, after they had lain in their Graves for ſome time, to come forth again and
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:52663:126"/> ſhew themſelves alive to their Friends, this wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Effect would be attributed by a great many to ſome <hi>Vital Principle</hi> in the Body, which only Slept for a while (as it does in Corn or other Seeds while they are kept dry and above Ground) but afterwards, when the Body was buried a while, was excited by ſome Natural Virtue that was in the Earth to exert it ſelf, and ſo by its <hi>Plaſtick Power</hi> formed the Body into the ſame ſhape it was in before.</p>
                  <p>This I ſay would in all probability be the Effect that the greateſt Miracles would have in the World, if they were very common; They'd only ſerve to ſet the Philoſophers Wits to work to invent <hi>new Forms</hi> of <hi>Matter,</hi> and <hi>new Laws</hi> of <hi>Motion</hi> by which to ſolve them; and any Solution of them, tho' never ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable, tho' only by <hi>Occult Qualities,</hi> would ſerve turn, and be thought better than to recur to an Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty Power. The Conſequence of which would be, that this which we deſire as an additional Proof of Chriſtianity, would in effect <hi>deſtroy</hi> one of the beſt Proofs of it that we have already. But,</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Laſtly, If it be ſuppoſed that Miracles would ſtill be thought Miracles notwithſtanding their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monneſs, yet <hi>Abraham</hi> might well deliver it as a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Truth, to which there are none or very few Exceptions; that he who is not wrought upon by a Standing Revelation of God's Will, would not be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded by an extraordinary Meſſage or a new Miracle; becauſe it is <hi>Matter</hi> of <hi>Fact</hi> and <hi>Experience</hi> that this laſt Method has been generally unſucceſsful upon thoſe who have not hearkned to nor been convinced by a Standing Revelation.</p>
                  <pb n="50" facs="tcp:52663:127"/>
                  <p>For this was the very Caſe of the <hi>Jews</hi> in our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's time; the Parable was literally fulfilled in them. For as they would not believe <hi>Moſes</hi> and the <hi>Prophets</hi> teſtifying of our <hi>Saviour,</hi> ſo neither did they any more believe our <hi>Saviour</hi> himſelf when he came down to them from Heaven in the Power of God; And as they did not believe him while he <hi>lived</hi> amongſt them, and went about Preaching and doing Miracles, ſo neither did they believe him a jot more after he <hi>came again</hi> to them from the <hi>dead.</hi> Never were there ſuch Signs and Miracles wrought for Mens Convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and yet never was there ſuch a number of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate Infidels as then. Very few even of thoſe who were Eye-witneſſes of our Saviour's Miracles were the better for them, but many were a great deal worſe, wilfully blaſpheming that Spirit by which he wrought them, and attributing thoſe Operations to the Help of the <hi>Devil</hi> which they were convinced in their own Judgments were done by the Power of God. <hi>The opening the Eyes of the Blind,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Joh. 9.39.11.47.12.10.</note> did but make thoſe that ſaw the Miracle more <hi>blind</hi> than they were before; And when once a <hi>dead Lazarus</hi> did come forth out of his Grave and appear to them, (which was the very thing that the <hi>Rich Man</hi> here deſires in the behalf of his Brethren, as being in his Judgment the moſt pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful, and ſo like to be the moſt effectual method to reclaim them; when I ſay this was done by our <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour</hi> in the preſence of a great number, ſo that the Truth of the Miracle could not be doubted, and was not denied by any of them) all the Effect that it had upon thoſe obſtinate and incredulous Men, was only that it made them enter preſently (ſooner perhaps than otherwiſe they would have done) into a cloſe
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:52663:127"/>

                  <p>Some Examples indeed, it muſt be granted, there are on the other ſide; For we are told in <hi>Acts</hi> xi. 41. of a great number <hi>about three thouſand</hi> that believed upon the firſt Preaching of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> and ſight of that great Miracle, the <hi>Gift</hi> of <hi>Tongues,</hi> wherewith the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> were endued.</p>
                  <p>But then it may be conſidered, that it was not the Miracle that convinced them, I mean not that alone; for many that were then preſent,<note place="margin">Verſe 13.</note> and heard the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles</hi> ſpeaking with <hi>Tongues,</hi> were ſo far from being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded thereby, that they moſt falſly blaſphemed that, as they had done all our <hi>Saviour</hi>'s Miracles before, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributing the fruit of that moſt evident Power of the Holy Ghoſt to <hi>new Wine.</hi> And it may be further no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that thoſe who were perſuaded by it, were ſuch as before they ſaw the Miracle were in a good Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to embrace that pure Religion that is taught in the Goſpel, or elſe that Miracle would not have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded them; for the Perſons convinced thereby were not of the <hi>Phariſees</hi> or <hi>unbelieving Jews</hi> that had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected our <hi>Saviour</hi> before,<note place="margin">Verſe 5.</note> but they were <hi>Devout Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, Jews</hi> or <hi>Proſelytes,</hi> who had come at that Feaſt of <hi>Pentecoſt,</hi> from other Parts of the World to <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi> to Worſhip, and who had probably never heard of our <hi>Saviour</hi> before more than by uncertain Report; but being well read in <hi>Moſes</hi> and the <hi>Prophets,</hi> and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving good heed to them, were Converted, more by the manifeſt Accompliſhment of all the ancient Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies concerning the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> in the Perſon of our <hi>Saviour,</hi> than by the ſight of that great Miracle.</p>
                  <pb n="52" facs="tcp:52663:128"/>
                  <p>This therefore being Matter of Fact and Experience, what has been done and come to paſs already, that new Miracles have been generally unſucceſsful upon ſuch as have not regarded a Standing Revelation of God's Will, we may reaſonably infer that 'tis highly probable if not certain, that the ſame Experiment tried over again would have no better ſucceſs.</p>
                  <p>The Summ of all therefore is this; ſuch as are (as St. <hi>Luke</hi> ſays they were who were Converted by the Preaching and Miracles of the <hi>Apoſtles</hi>)<note n="*" place="margin">

And on the other ſide, ſuch as only do need them, that is ſuch as being of perverſe Minds, and ſtubborn Wills, and devoted to

                  <p>I ſhall conclude all with an uſeful Exhortation; <hi>firſt</hi> to <hi>Infidels,</hi> who will not by all that has been ſaid be perſuaded to admit this divine Revelation; and <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly</hi> to <hi>Chriſtians</hi> who do <hi>receive</hi> it.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. To you who are yet <hi>Infidels,</hi> (if there are any ſuch here, as I hope there are not; or if theſe Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:52663:129"/> ſhall happen to fall into the Hands of any ſuch) I beg leave to addreſs my ſelf in a few words.</p>
                  <p>And I would deſire you, in the firſt Place, to <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare</hi> and <hi>diſpoſe</hi> your Minds to hear gravely and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out prejudice the Reaſons that are offered to prove the Truth of Chriſtianity, by <hi>conſidering</hi> ſeriouſly the <hi>great Importance</hi> of <hi>Religion,</hi> if it be true. And if you do but conſider this, you will quickly ſee that it is well worth your while to be at ſome pains to ſatisfie your ſelves fully whether Religion be true or not. For if Religion be true (and you can't be ſure it is not, till you have well examined the Grounds and Proofs of it) you have a great Concern at ſtake; and in a Matter of ſuch Moment it becomes not a Wiſe Man to be determined by a Jeſt or a Quibble. And if you ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly <hi>conſider</hi> the <hi>great Importance</hi> of <hi>Religion,</hi> you will likewiſe readily ſee, that of the two you had much better be <hi>miſtaken</hi> in <hi>believing</hi> the Truth of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, tho' it be falſe, than in <hi>disbelieving</hi> it, if in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it be true; ſo that conſequently if it can ever be reaſonable for a Wiſe Man to be under a <hi>Prejudice,</hi> it would be moſt reaſonable that you ſhould be <hi>prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced</hi> on the ſide of Religion. You will alſo then ſee, that if in any Caſe it be Wiſdom to be <hi>over-credulous,</hi> that is, to believe beyond the ſtrength of the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, it is ſo in the Caſe of Religion; becauſe the greateſt Damage you can ſuffer by <hi>Over-credulity,</hi> in caſe Religion be all a Cheat, is infinitely leſs than will be the Conſequence of <hi>unreaſonable Infidelity,</hi> if indeed Religion be true.</p>
                  <p>Next, I would deſire you to examine your ſelves ſeriouſly, whether in your Enquiries into the Grounds and Reaſons of Religion, you have not hitherto had
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:52663:129"/> ſome <hi>Byaſs</hi> upon your Minds; whether at the ſame time that you have ſet your ſelves to conſider of the Proofs of the Chriſtian Religion, you have not ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly <hi>wiſhed</hi> that you might not find them ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory to your Reaſon. And if ſo, I deſire you to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine further, what was the <hi>Cauſe</hi> of this; whether it was not ſome worldly <hi>Pleaſure</hi> or <hi>Profit</hi> which you foreſaw you ſhould be debarr'd from in caſe you ſhould happen to be convinced of the Truth of the Chriſtian Religion. And if it was, I hope that ſome ſerious Conſideration of the great Importance of Religion, which I before adviſed in order to the removing unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Prejudices, will alſo ſuffice to ſatisfie you how unworthy of any Love or Regard any Worldly Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure or Profit is in Compariſion with that Eternal Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs which is promiſed in the Goſpel; ſo that conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently when you are enquiring into the Grounds and Reaſons of our Hope of that Eternal Life, all other Thoughts ought to be laid aſide, and you ought to have no Eye at all to any thing elſe; becauſe to a Man who muſt be unſpeakably happy or miſerable to all Eternity (which is the Caſe of all of us, if indeed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

But I can't but hope, I can't but think that if you do conſider without Prejudice or Partiality the Reaſons that have been offered to prove the Truth of Chriſtianity, you muſt needs be convinced thereby.</p>
                  <p>However, if the Reaſons that are or may be offer'd for the Proof of it ſhould not be ſufficient perfectly to <hi>cure</hi> your <hi>Infidelity</hi> and to make you become <hi>Zealous Chriſtians;</hi> they may be, and they certainly are, ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to ſatisfie you that the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> have <hi>ſome Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> for their Belief; even the <hi>ſame</hi> at leaſt (if not bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter) that you your ſelves are ſwayed by in all other Caſes; and conſequently that they are not ſuch very eaſie and credulous Fools as you perhaps have hitherto taken them to be. I'm confident you muſt grant that if the Reaſons of our Religion are not demonſtrative, they are at leaſt <hi>probable;</hi> and that if our Religion be not true, it has at leaſt a fair <hi>ſhew</hi> and <hi>Appearance</hi> of Truth.</p>
                  <p>And if you will but only allow this, 'tis then a Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Requeſt, and what I would next deſire of you, not to make a <hi>Boaſt</hi> of your <hi>Unbelief;</hi> not to <hi>ridicule</hi> our holy <hi>Religion;</hi> not to make it your Buſineſs to <hi>proſelyte</hi> Men to <hi>Atheiſm</hi> and <hi>Infidelity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. Not to make a <hi>Boaſt</hi> of your <hi>Unbelief;</hi> For if in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed you have no Religion, yet what <hi>Intereſt</hi> can you have in telling the World ſo? Nay is there any thing that you could do, more to your own Prejudice? For tho' you are not under the Direction and Influence of any Religious Principles, yet ſo long as you appear to have ſome Religion you will be employed and truſted as other Men are; Men will believe you to be Honeſt
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:52663:130"/>
'till they ſhall find to the contrary; and in the mean time you will have an Opportunity of raiſing your ſelves to Wealth and Honour. But when once the World ſhall come to know that you are Men of no Principles, that you are under no Reſtraints of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that you will do whatever you can ſafely do for your own Advantage; that is, whatever you can do without danger of a Priſon, a Pillory or a Gibbet; (and they will have Reaſon to think all this of you, when you your ſelves ſhall tell them that you are of no Religion;) Who, do you think, will employ you? Who, do you think, will truſt you? So that the only way you will then have to make your Fortunes, will be by open Force and Violence; and in that you will meet with ſuch oppoſition from all the World, as will quickly work your Ruine.</p>
                  <p>But you think, it may be, that 'tis a mean and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generous thing to diſown your Principles, or rather your <hi>no Principles;</hi> that it is beneath a Man to ſeem to be what he is not; and to put on a face of Religion when he has none, how profitable ſoever his Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie might be to him.</p>
                  <p>Very well; Then you may (if you are willing to ſuffer the Inconvenience of it) freely own your ſelves to be of no Religion; but at the ſame time you ſhould do well to conſider that the greateſt part of the World is againſt you; that not only the Ignorant and Illite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, but the Wiſeſt, the Graveſt, the moſt Learned and the moſt Noble Perſons have generally been Men of Religion; or at leaſt, (which is all we can judge by) have outwardly profeſſed themſelves perſuaded of the Truth of it, and have expreſſed the greateſt Zeal and Concern for it.

But if you will needs be attacking our Religion, compoſe your ſelves firſt to Gravity and Seriouſneſs; and let it be ſeen by your way of Treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us, that your Deſign is manly and generous, only to undeceive and diſabuſe us, not to make Sport with us.<note place="margin">Iſa. 41.21.</note>

                  </p>
                  <p>For whether our Religion be true or falſe, it is <hi>better</hi> for <hi>you,</hi> as well as for all the World beſides, that it ſhould be generally believed; and that Men ſhould think themſelves obliged to live according to the Rules and Precepts of it. You can't, ſurely, be ſo unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted

So that if you ſhould ſucceed in your En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour, if you ſhould be able either to reaſon or to laugh Religion quite out of the World, the moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, nay the moſt certain Conſequence of it would be, that when the <hi>Godly Man ceaſed,</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>If therefore you have (as you think perhaps you have) found out the <hi>Cheat</hi> of <hi>Religion;</hi> 'tis your beſt Prudence, however, to keep your Diſcovery to your ſelves. Delight your ſelves as much as you will with the Contemplation of your own Happineſs above other Men, in that you are now freed from the Terrors of Conſcience and the Fears of another World, by means of that notable Diſcovery which you have made of the Vanity of Religion; pleaſe your ſelves as much as you will with thinking that are not now as others are, tied to ſpeak truth when 'tis to your diſadvantage, to ſuffer any thing in this World for Conſcience ſake, or to be juſt and honeſt in your Dealings, when you can get conſiderably by Fraud and Oppreſſion, and can or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Matter ſo ſecretly as to ſafe from Diſcovery, and conſequently from all Shame and Puniſhment from Men: But be the Advantage which you have
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:52663:132"/> gained to your ſelves by diſcovering the Cheat of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion never ſo great, yet the greater it is, and the greater you think it, ſo much the more cautious you ought to be not to make known to others what you have ſo happily diſcovered; for when once others ſhall come to know as much as you think you do, <hi>viz.</hi> That all <hi>Religion</hi> is a <hi>Cheat,</hi> all your Advantage above them will ceaſe; they will then be all upon the ſame Terms with you; they will then be all as much at Liberty to defraud, oppreſs or otherwiſe injure you, as you are now to defraud oppreſs or injure them. You ought not therefore in Prudence, to try to convince them of their Miſtake, tho' you were ſure it was a Miſtake; for why ſhould you make it your Buſineſs to cut in ſunder thoſe Cords of Religion, by which they are now tied up from doing you miſchief?</p>
                  <p>In a word; either Religion is <hi>true</hi> and <hi>well grounded,</hi> or it is <hi>not:</hi> and which ſoever it be, it is better both for <hi>them</hi> that do believe the Truth of it, and for <hi>you</hi> alſo, that they ſhould continue in the Belief of it; why then ſhould you be at Pains only to do miſchief?</p>
                  <p>For put Caſe, <hi>firſt,</hi> that Religion is <hi>vain</hi> and ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, it muſt be confeſſed however that it is of ſome <hi>preſent Advantage</hi> to <hi>them</hi> that do <hi>believe</hi> it; becauſe it ſerves to bear them up under the unavoidable Pains and Troubles and Miſery of this Mortal Life with the comfortable Hope of a bleſſed Immortality; and it will be no Diſadvantage to them hereafter; for when they are dead, if indeed there be no Life after this, they will be as if they had never been, they will not be then in a Capacity of grieving for their Diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And it is alſo for <hi>your preſent Advantage,</hi> that they that are miſtaken in believing the Truth of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:52663:132"/> ſhould <hi>continue</hi> in their Miſtake; becauſe it makes them better to you in every Relation than they would otherwiſe be, more Juſt and Merciful Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, more Loyal and Obedient Subjects, more Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Parents, more Dutiful Children, more Gentle Maſters, more Faithful Servants, and more Juſt, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt and Loving Neighbours; why then ſhould you be at any Pains to Cure that Miſtake (if it be a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake) which does <hi>them</hi> no harm, but rather good; and which is likewiſe ſo profitable for <hi>you?</hi> Eſpecially when you can't be ſo vain as to expect to merit Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven (if indeed there be no Heaven) by your <hi>Zeal</hi> for the <hi>Truth</hi> of <hi>Atheiſm.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But if indeed Religion be true; (and you can't be ſure it is not, how deficient ſoever you may think our Proofs of it are) as I ſhall not need to ſay that it will be better for <hi>them</hi> that <hi>believe</hi> it, that they ſhould per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt in their Belief of it; ſo I ſhall not need to ſay much to ſhew that it will, in the Event, be better for <hi>you,</hi> that you ſhould not endeavour to <hi>pervert</hi> them; for, certainly, if there be a Hell, they will be condemned to the hotteſt place in it, who not only withdrew themſelves from their Subjection to Almighty God, and would not ſuffer him to reign over them; but made it alſo their Buſineſs to <hi>corrupt</hi> others, to form a Party againſt Heaven, and to raiſe an Univerſal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion againſt God.</p>
                  <p>Theſe things, and more to the like Purpoſe I would ſay to the <hi>Atheiſts,</hi> if I thought they were here to hear me. And I ſhould not be without Hope, that altho' what was ſaid before in the foregoing Diſcourſes was not ſufficient to cure their <hi>Infidelity,</hi> what has been now ſaid might ſerve to convince them that it is the
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:52663:133"/> wiſeſt Courſe to keep their <hi>Infidelity</hi> to themſelves; that how little ſoever they believe of the the Truth of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, it is not <hi>Prudence</hi> to tell the World that they are Men of no Principles, and conſequently not fit to be employed or truſted; that 'tis not <hi>good Manners</hi> to make a Jeſt of Serious and Sacred things, and to affront the common Reaſon and Judgment of Mankind; and that 'tis not for their <hi>Intereſt</hi> to endeavour to bring other Men over to their ſide, becauſe if none had more Religion than themſelves, they could not be near ſo ſafe and ſecure in their Rights and Poſſeſſions, and in their Lives (the only things they value) as they now are.</p>
                  <p>But I do not think there are any here preſent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd in this Part of my Diſcourſe, and therefore ſhall lengthen it no further.<note place="margin">Heb. 6.9.</note> 
                     <hi>I am perſuaded better things of you, and things that accompany Salvation;</hi> For your <hi>Preſence</hi> here, in the <hi>Houſe</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and in the <hi>Aſſembly</hi> of <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> makes it reaſonable to believe, that you are already convinced, not only of the <hi>Being</hi> and <hi>Providence</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> but likewiſe of the <hi>Truth</hi> of the <hi>Chriſtian Religion</hi> and of the <hi>Divine Inſpiration</hi> and <hi>Authority</hi> of the <hi>Holy Scriptures.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. To you therefore who are <hi>Chriſtians</hi> I ſhall now turn my Diſcourſe.<note place="margin">Heb. 13.22.</note> 
                     <hi>And I beſeech you, Brethren, ſuffer the word of Exhortation;</hi> it is only this.</p>
                  <p>Since you have <hi>Moſes</hi> and the <hi>Prophets,</hi> and <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> and <hi>believe</hi> that they are <hi>Meſſengers</hi> to you from <hi>God</hi> to inſtruct you in his Will; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Truth and the Law at their Mouths; mind what they ſay, and be careful to follow their Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions in all things.</p>
                  <pb n="63" facs="tcp:52663:133"/>
                  <p>For even <hi>we</hi> who have the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> the <hi>lively Oracles of God,</hi> may periſh for want of Knowledge as well as they that have them not, unleſs we make that Uſe of them which they were given for; unleſs we are diligent in reading them, and careful to practiſe what they teach. For the <hi>Rich Man</hi> ſpoken of in this <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable</hi> had the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> but his meer having them did not keep him from <hi>Hell.</hi> And his <hi>five</hi> ſurviving <hi>Brethren</hi> had likewiſe the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> and yet were then in a fair way of following their Brother to that <hi>Place of Torment. They had Moſes and the Prophets</hi> but <hi>they did not hear them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And this alſo may be our Caſe, who have not only <hi>theſe,</hi> but alſo <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his <hi>Apoſtles</hi> Preaching to us; if we do not <hi>hear</hi> them; for what Advantage can it be to us to have good Inſtructors, if we will not mind what they ſay; if we ſtop our ears to all their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels and Reproofs? No Man was ever made a Scholar only by having a good Library in his Poſſeſſion: No Man ever learnt any Art or Science, tho' it was never ſo well taught in any Book, only by keeping the Book in his Chamber, or carrying it about in his Pocket. And as little ſhall we be the wiſer only by having the Holy Scriptures, tho' (as the Apoſtle ſays) they are <hi>able to make us wiſe unto Salvation,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 Tim. 3.15.</note> if we do not read and ſtudy them with an honeſt Deſign to furniſh our ſelves from thence with a ſtock of uſeful Knowlege, and with a firm Reſolution to lead our Lives accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Directions which they give us.</p>
                  <p>Nay ſo far ſhall be from receiving any Advantage only by our having the Holy Scriptures given us, and free Liberty allowed us to look into them, (a Privilege we of this Nation have above moſt of our Neighbours)
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:52663:134"/> that if we do not read and ſtudy them, it will be much the worſe for us; our Condemnation will be the greater, and our Deſtruction ſo much the more certain. For the Caſe of thoſe who offend thro' Ignorance, when their Ignorance is unaffected, is very pitiable; and tho' we can't certainly ſay how God will deal with thoſe who had no clear Revelation of his Will made to them; this we may be ſure of, that God, who is a merciful God, will deal mercifully with them.<note place="margin">John 15.22.</note> 
                     <hi>If I had not come and ſpoken unto them,</hi> ſays our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, <hi>they had not had Sin.</hi> But the Caſe will be quite otherwiſe with thoſe,<note place="margin">Luke 12.47.</note> who <hi>knew their Maſter's will and did not do it; They,</hi> as our Saviour ſays, <hi>ſhall be beaten with many Stripes.</hi> And it will be all one if they did not know it, if their Ignorance of it was occaſioned by their own fault, in neglecting thoſe Means of Knowledge which God has afforded them; And much rather, if their ignorance of their Duty was affected and choſen, that they might Sin with leſs diſturbance of Mind; for our Saviour's Judgment in this Caſe is very plain and (and 'tis his Judgment by which we muſt ſtand or fall to all Eternity) <hi>Joh.</hi> iii. 19. <hi>This is the Condemnation that Light is come into the World, and Men lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Darkneſs rather than Light, becauſe their Deeds were Evil.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Having therefore <hi>Moſes</hi> and the <hi>Prophets,</hi> and alſo <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> continually Preaching to us in the <hi>Books</hi> of <hi>Holy Scripture, let us hear them;</hi> This is both our Duty, and our Intereſt.</p>
                  <p>And that our ſtudy of the Scripture may be with good ſucceſs, and we may thereby be <hi>thoroughly furniſhed unto all good Work;</hi> Let us Pray as we are taught by our Church in a moſt excellent <hi>Collect</hi> ſuited to the Subject I have been Diſcourſing of.</p>
